# SEO & Meta

- Every page must export `title`, `description`, and `image` from its `+config.ts` file (see `pages/+config.ts` for the base config).
- Shared head tags (Open Graph, Twitter, canonical URL, etc.) are centralised in `pages/+Head.tsx` — don't duplicate them in individual pages.
- Each page should have exactly one `<h1>`. Use `<h2>` and below for subsections.
- Use descriptive, keyword-relevant text for headings — avoid generic titles like "Welcome" or "Home".
- Anchor links to external sites should use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `target="_blank"` where appropriate.
