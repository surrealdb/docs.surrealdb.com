# File Conventions

- **Pages**: New pages go in `pages/` following Vike filesystem routing (e.g. `pages/my-page/+Page.tsx`).
- **Components**: Place in `components/` with styles alongside (e.g. `components/MyComponent/index.tsx` + `style.module.scss`).
- **Content**: Blog posts, events, releases, and other content go in `content/` with appropriate frontmatter.
- **Utilities**: Shared helpers, hooks, and API functions go in `lib/`.
- **Modals**: Modal components go in `modals/`.
- **Assets**: Static images, styles, and data files go in `assets/`.
- Don't create new top-level directories without discussing it first.
