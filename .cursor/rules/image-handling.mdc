# Image Handling

- Always provide descriptive `alt` text that conveys the image's purpose.
- Prefer existing image components (e.g. `DescriptiveImage`) over raw `<img>` tags.
- Use WebP or AVIF formats where possible for smaller file sizes.
- Add `loading="lazy"` to images below the fold.
- Avoid enormous inline SVGs. Extract them to separate files or use the `Icon` component from `@surrealdb/ui`.
- Specify `width` and `height` (or aspect ratio) to prevent layout shifts during loading.
