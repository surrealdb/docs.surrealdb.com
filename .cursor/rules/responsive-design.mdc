# Responsive Design

- Use Mantine's responsive props (`hiddenFrom`, `visibleFrom`) to show/hide elements by breakpoint instead of CSS media queries.
- Use Mantine's responsive style props where available (e.g. `px={{ base: "md", sm: "xl" }}`).
- Avoid fixed pixel widths on containers. Use `maw`, `w="100%"`, or Mantine grid/flex utilities.
- Use `rem` or Mantine spacing tokens instead of `px` for spacing and sizing.
- When writing SCSS, use `@surrealdb/ui` breakpoint mixins if available, or Mantine's `em()` helper for consistent breakpoints.
- Test that layouts don't overflow or break at narrow viewports (~320px).
- Prefer stacking (flex column) over side-by-side layouts on mobile.
