# DEFINE INDEX

# `DEFINE INDEX` statement

Just like in other databases, SurrealDB uses indexes to help optimize query performance. An index can consist of one or more fields in a table and can enforce a uniqueness constraint. If you don't intend for your index to have a uniqueness constraint, then the fields you select for your index should have a high degree of cardinality, meaning that there is a high amount of diversity between the data in the indexed table records.

## Requirements
- You must be authenticated as a root or namespace user before you can use the `DEFINE INDEX` statement.
- [You must select your namespace and database](docs/surrealQl/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE INDEX` statement.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE INDEX @name ON [ TABLE ] @table [ FIELDS | COLUMNS ] @fields
	[ UNIQUE | SEARCH ANALYZER @analyzer [ BM25 [(@k1, @b)] ] [ HIGHLIGHTS ] ]
```

## Example usage
How to create a unique index for the email address field on a user table.

```surql
-- Make sure that email addresses in the user table are always unique
DEFINE INDEX userEmailIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;
```
How to create a non-unique index for an age field on a user table.

```surql
-- optimise queries looking for users of a given age
DEFINE INDEX userAgeIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS age;
```
How to create a full-text search index for a name field on a user table.

```surql
-- Allow full-text search queries on the name of the user
DEFINE INDEX userNameIndex ON TABLE user COLUMNS name SEARCH ANALYZER ascii BM25 HIGHLIGHTS;
```
