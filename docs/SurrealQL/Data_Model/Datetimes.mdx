# Datatimes 

## Datatimes

SurrealDB has native support for datetimes with nanosecond precision. SurrealDB automatically parses and understands datetimes which are written as strings in the SurrealQL language. Times must also be formatted in an [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

```sql
CREATE event SET time = "2022-07-03T07:18:52Z";
```
SurrealDB handles all datetimes with nanosecond precision.

```sql
CREATE event SET time = "2022-07-03T07:18:52.841147Z";
```

SurrealDB handles all timezones, and automatically converts and stores datetimes as a UTC date.

```sql
CREATE event SET time = "2022-07-03T07:18:52.841147+02:00";
```

## Datetime comparison
Datetimes can be compared with each other using the advanced SurrealDB operators.

```sql
SELECT * FROM "2022-07-03T07:18:52Z" > "2022-01-03T01:43:78Z";
```

## Datetimes and durations

Durations can be used to modify and alter datetimes.

```sql
CREATE event SET time = "2022-07-03T07:18:52Z" + 2w;
```

Multi-part durations can also be used to modify datetimes.

```sql
CREATE event SET time = "2022-07-03T07:18:52.841147Z" + 1h30m20s1350ms;
```

## Next steps
You've now seen how to store, modify, and handle dates and times in SurrealDB. For more advanced functionality, take a look at the [time](/docs/surrealql/functions/time) functions, which enable extracting, altering, rounding, and grouping datetimes into specific time intervals.
