# THROW

## `THROW` statement

The `THROW` statement can be used to throw an error in a place where something unexpected is happening. Execution of the query will be aborted and the error will be returned to the client.

### Statement syntax

```sql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
THROW @error
```

## Example usage

The following query shows example usage of this statement.

```sql
-- Throw an error
THROW "some error message";
```
The following query shows the `THROW` statement being used to send back a custom error to the client.

```sql
-- In this example, we throw a custom error when a user provides invalid signin details
DEFINE SCOPE user SESSION 1w
	SIGNIN {
		LET $user = (SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = $username AND crypto::argon2::compare(password, $password));
		IF !$user {
			THROW "You either provided invalid credentials, or a user with the username " + <string> $username + " might not exist.";
		};

		RETURN $user;
	};
```
