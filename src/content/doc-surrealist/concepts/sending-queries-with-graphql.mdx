# Sending queries with GraphQL (experimental)

The GraphQL view in Surrealist allows you to write, execute, and visualize GraphQL queries in real-time. You can see the results of your queries in JSON structure returned by GraphQL.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GraphQL is an experimental feature. We cannot guarantee that it will provide the same security guarantees as SurrealQL. It is not recommended for production use. We welcome your feedback and contributions to help improve the feature and make it more robust.
