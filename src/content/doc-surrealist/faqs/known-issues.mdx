# Known Issues

Here are some known bugs and issues with Surrealist:

## Interface

- Some users may experience issues with the interface not loading correctly. This can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as network issues, browser cache, or browser extensions. Since Surrealist uses the browser native webview, it may be caused by an outdated browser version.

## Query view

- Querying certain binary data such as byte types causes Surrealist to crash. This is a known issue and is being worked on.
- Formatting a query strips out comments and white space. This happens because we parse the query into SurrealDB and pretty print it, however since the parser does not retain comments these are lost.

## Explorer view

- Editing a record will cause futures to be computed into their values. This means you will have to manually set these fields back to future values.

## Designer view

- The table graph will sometimes become invisible while still functioning correctly. We have not been able to reproduce this issue internally so far.
