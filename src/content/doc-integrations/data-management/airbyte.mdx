# Airbyte

This guide helps you configure SurrealDB as a destination in [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com) using the [official connector](https://github.com/surrealdb/airbyte-connector).

## Prerequisites
To connect SurrealDB to Airbyte, you need the following:

- An Airbyte deployment with access to the SurrealDB destination connector.
- SurrealDB v2.2.0 or later.
- A SurrealDB instance (self-hosted or Surreal Cloud) reachable by Airbyte.
- A token or user credentials with `DEFINE TABLE`, `DEFINE INDEX`, `UPSERT`, `SELECT`, and `REMOVE` permissions.

## Setup instructions

Follow these steps to configure SurrealDB as a destination. You can use either a self-hosted instance or Surreal Cloud.

Before proceeding, ensure you have the endpoint URL and credentials for your SurrealDB instance and that Airbyte can reach it over the network.

#### Option 1: Self-hosted SurrealDB

1. Ensure your SurrealDB instance is reachable from Airbyte. This might involve opening network access or configuring an SSH tunnel.
2. Create a dedicated user or token in SurrealDB, for example:

```surql
DEFINE USER airbyte ON ROOT PASSWORD "YourPassword" ROLES OWNER;
```

Use the generated credentials when setting up the destination.

#### Option 2: Surreal Cloud

1. Visit the [Instances page](https://surrealist.app/cloud/instances) and select your instance.
2. Click **Connect with Surreal CLI** to obtain a connection command containing the `--endpoint` and authentication details.
3. Verify you can connect using `surreal sql` with those parameters.

## Finish Airbyte configuration

1. Open the Airbyte dashboard and add a new **Destination**.
2. Select **SurrealDB** from the list of destination types.
3. Provide the host, port, namespace, database, and either the username/password or token you created earlier.
4. Click **Set up destination** and run the connection test.

Upon a successful test, you can start syncing data from your sources into SurrealDB tables. Each stream is written to its own table with columns `_airbyte_raw_id`, `_airbyte_extracted_at`, and `_airbyte_data`.
