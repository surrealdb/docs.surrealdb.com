# Qyrus

**Qyrus Data Testing** is a data quality assurance platform that integrates with SurrealDB. Use it to validate data, compare datasets across sources, and run quality checks on SurrealDB tables using SurrealQL queries.

## Overview

- **Integration type**: SurrealDB multi-model database connector for Qyrus Data Testing
- **Primary use**: Data quality assurance, cross-source comparison, and single-source validation
- **Query language**: SurrealQL for fetching and validating data
- **Documentation**: [Qyrus Data Testing](https://docs.qyrus.com/data-testing)

## Use Cases

Qyrus supports two job types when using SurrealDB as a data source:

| Job Type | Description | Example Scenarios |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Compare Job** | Validates differences between two data sources | Data migrations, synchronization checks, production vs. staging comparison, source vs. target validation |
| **Evaluate Job** | Validates a single SurrealDB data source | Schema checks, constraint validation, data profiling, quality rules, custom business logic |

## Configuration Parameters

When configuring SurrealDB as a data source in Qyrus, use the following parameters:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Parameter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Host URL</strong></td>
      <td>SurrealDB server URL (HTTP / HTTPS / WebSocket)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Port</strong></td>
      <td>Port on which the SurrealDB service is running</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Namespace</strong></td>
      <td>SurrealDB namespace to connect to</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Database Name</strong></td>
      <td>Target database inside the namespace</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Username</strong></td>
      <td>Login username (if authentication is enabled)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Password</strong></td>
      <td>Login password (if authentication is enabled)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Query</strong></td>
      <td>SurrealQL query that fetches data from the selected table</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Enable Limit &amp; Offset</strong> (Optional)</td>
      <td>Enables pagination controls for query execution</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Getting Started

To set up SurrealDB with Qyrus Data Testing:

1. Visit the [Qyrus Data Testing documentation](https://docs.qyrus.com/data-testing) for an overview of the platform
2. Configure SurrealDB as a data source using the [SurrealDB connector guide](https://docs.qyrus.com/data-testing/data-sources/surreal)
3. Create and run [Compare](https://docs.qyrus.com/data-testing/jobs/compare-job) or [Evaluate](https://docs.qyrus.com/data-testing/jobs/evaluate-job) jobs as needed
4. View validation results in [Job History](https://docs.qyrus.com/data-testing) and detailed reports for completed jobs

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Qyrus Data Testing?

Qyrus Data Testing is a data quality assurance tool that enables cross-source comparisons (Compare Jobs) and internal validations (Evaluate Jobs) to maintain reliable and accurate data across databases and systems.

### How does SurrealDB integrate with Qyrus?

SurrealDB is available as a connector in Qyrus. You configure the connection using Host URL, Port, Namespace, Database Name, and optionally Username and Password. Data is fetched from SurrealDB using SurrealQL queries that you define in Qyrus.

### When should I use a Compare Job vs. an Evaluate Job?

- **Compare Job**: Use when you need to validate that two data sources match (e.g., after a migration, during sync checks, or when comparing production and staging).
- **Evaluate Job**: Use when you need to validate a single SurrealDB data source (e.g., schema checks, data profiling, quality rules, or custom logic).

### What SurrealQL queries can I use in Qyrus?

You can use any valid SurrealQL query that fetches data from your SurrealDB tables. The query runs against the configured Namespace and Database. Examples: `SELECT * FROM table`, `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 100`, or more complex queries with filters and joins.

### Does Qyrus support SurrealDB authentication?

Yes. If your SurrealDB instance has authentication enabled, provide the **Username** and **Password** in the Qyrus connector configuration.
