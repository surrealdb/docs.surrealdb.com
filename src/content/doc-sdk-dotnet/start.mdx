# Quick start

Now that you have a more comprehensive understanding of the SurrealDB SDK for .NET, let's create a simple project to get you started.
This guide will walk you through creating a simple console application that uses the SurrealDB SDK for .NET to interact with a SurrealDB instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to see the final project for this guide, you can find it [here](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb.net/tree/main/SurrealDb.Examples.Console) and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to get the project running.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following:
- You have a basic understanding of the .NET ecosystem and the C# language.
- You have an install version of SurrealDB `>1.4.2` installed on your machine.

## Setup your project

Let's start by creating a new console app.

```bash
# Create a new console app
dotnet new console -o SurrealDbExample

# Navigate into the generated directory
cd SurrealDbExample

# Add the SurrealDB SDK to your project via the dotnet CLI
dotnet add package SurrealDb.Net
```

Open <code>Program.cs</code> and replace everything in there with the following code to try out some basic operations using the SurrealDB SDK.

```csharp
using SurrealDb.Net;
using SurrealDb.Net.Models;
using SurrealDb.Net.Models.Auth;
using System.Text.Json;

const string TABLE = "person";

using var db = new SurrealDbClient("ws://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc");

await db.SignIn(new RootAuth { Username = "root", Password = "root" });
await db.Use("test", "test");

var person = new Person
{
	Title = "Founder & CEO",
	Name = new() { FirstName = "Tobie", LastName = "Morgan Hitchcock" },
	Marketing = true
};
var created = await db.Create(TABLE, person);
Console.WriteLine(ToJsonString(created));

var updated = await db.Merge<ResponsibilityMerge, Person>(
	new() { Id = (TABLE, "jaime"), Marketing = true }
);
Console.WriteLine(ToJsonString(updated));

var people = await db.Select<Person>(TABLE);
Console.WriteLine(ToJsonString(people));

var queryResponse = await db.Query(
    $"SELECT Marketing, count() AS Count FROM type::table({TABLE}) GROUP BY Marketing"
);
var groups = queryResponse.GetValue<List<Group>>(0);
Console.WriteLine(ToJsonString(groups));

static string ToJsonString(object? o)
{
    return JsonSerializer.Serialize(o, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true, });
}

public class Person : Record
{
	public string? Title { get; set; }
	public Name? Name { get; set; }
	public bool Marketing { get; set; }
}
public class Name
{
	public string? FirstName { get; set; }
	public string? LastName { get; set; }
}
public class ResponsibilityMerge : Record
{
	public bool Marketing { get; set; }
}
public class Group
{
	public bool Marketing { get; set; }
	public int Count { get; set; }
}
```

Then make sure your SurrealDB server is running on <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code> and run your app from the command line with:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Next steps

Now that you have learned the basics of the .NET SDK for SurrealDB, you can learn more about the SDK and its methods [in the methods section](/docs/sdk/dotnet/methods) and [data types section](/docs/sdk/dotnet/data-types).
