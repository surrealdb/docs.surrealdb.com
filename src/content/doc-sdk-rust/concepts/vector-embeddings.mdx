# Vector embeddings

The quickest way to retrieve vector embeddings is to use the [fastembed crate](/docs/integrations/embeddings/fastembed#language-specific-examples), which does not require a user key or calling into an external service.

The following blog posts include runnable examples using vector embeddings via the Rust SDK.
