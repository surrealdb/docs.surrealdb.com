# `LET` Statement

The `LET` statement allows you to create parameters to store any value, including the results of queries or the outputs of expressions. These parameters can then be referenced throughout your SurrealQL code, making your queries more dynamic and reusable.

## Syntax

The syntax for the `LET` statement is straightforward. The parameter name is prefixed with a `$` symbol.

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
LET $@parameter [: @type_name] = @value;
```

## Example Usage

### Basic Parameter Assignment

You can use the `LET` statement to store simple values or query results. For example, storing a string value and then using it in a `CREATE` statement:

```surql
-- Define the parameter
LET $name = "tobie";
-- Use the parameter
CREATE person SET name = $name;
```

### Storing Query Results

The `LET` statement is also useful for storing the results of a subquery, which can then be used in subsequent operations:

```surql
-- Define the parameter
LET $adults = (SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 18);
-- Use the parameter
UPDATE $adults SET adult = true;
```

### Conditional Logic with `IF ELSE`

SurrealQL allows you to define parameters based on conditional logic using `IF ELSE` statements:

```surql
LET $num = 10;

LET $num_type =
         IF type::is::int($num)     { "integer" }
    ELSE IF type::is::decimal($num) { "decimal" }
    ELSE IF type::is::float($num)   { "float"   };
```

## Anonymous Functions

You can define anonymous functions also known as closures using the `LET` statement. These functions can be used to encapsulate reusable logic and can be called from within your queries. Learn more about [anonymous functions](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/closures) in the Data model section.


## Pre-Defined and Protected Parameters

SurrealDB comes with [pre-defined parameters](/docs/surrealql/parameters) that are accessible in any context. However, parameters created using `LET` are not accessible within the scope of these pre-defined parameters.

Furthermore, some pre-defined parameters are protected and cannot be overwritten using `LET`:

```surql
LET $before = "Before!";

-- Returns ["Before!"];
RETURN $before;

-- Returns the `person` records before deletion
DELETE person RETURN $before;

-- Returns "Before!" again
RETURN $before;
```

Attempting to redefine protected parameters will result in an error:

```surql
LET $auth = 1;
LET $session = 10;
```

```surql title="Output"
-------- Query 1 (0ns) --------

"'auth' is a protected variable and cannot be set"

-------- Query 2 (0ns) --------

"'session' is a protected variable and cannot be set"
```

## Typed LET statements

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

Type safety in a `LET` statement can be ensured by adding a `:` (a colon) and the type name after the `LET` keyword.

```surql
LET $number: int = "9";
```

```surql title="Output"
"Found '9' for param $number, but expected a int"
```

### Taking advantage of type safety

Using typed `LET` statements is a good practice when prototyping code or when getting used to SurrealQL for the first time. Take the following example that attempts to count the number of `true` values in a field by filtering out values that are not `true`, without noticing that the field actually contains strings instead of booleans. The query output ends up being 3, rather than the expected 2.

```surql
CREATE some:record SET vals = ["true", "false", "true"];
some:record.vals.filter(|$val| $val = true).len();
```

```surql title="Output"
3
```

Breaking this into multiple typed `LET` statements shows the error right away.

```surql
LET $vals: array<bool> = some:record.vals;
LET $len: number = $vals.filter(|$val| $val = true).len();
$len;
```

```surql title="Output"
-------- Query 1 --------

"Found 'true' for param $vals, but expected a array<bool>"

-------- Query 2 --------

'There was a problem running the filter() function. no such method found for the none type'

-------- Query 3 --------

NONE
```

With the location of the error in clear sight, a fix is that much easier to implement.

```surql
-- Use .map() to turn each string into a bool
LET $vals: array<bool> = some:record.vals.map(|$val| <bool>$val);
LET $len: number = $vals.filter(|$val| $val = true).len();
$len;
```

```surql title="Output"
2
```

### Typed literal statements

Multiple possible types can be specified in a `LET` statement by adding a `|` (vertical bar) in between each possible type.

```surql
LET $number: int | string = "9";
```

Even complex types such as objects can be included in a typed `LET` statement.

```surql
LET $error_info: string | { error: string } = { error: "Something went wrong plz help" };
```

For more information on this pattern, see the page on [literals](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/literals).

## Conclusion

The `LET` statement in SurrealDB is versatile, allowing you to store values, results from subqueries, and even define anonymous functions. Understanding how to use `LET` effectively can help you write more concise, readable, and maintainable queries.
