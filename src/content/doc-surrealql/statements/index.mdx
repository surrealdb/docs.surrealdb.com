# Statements

SurrealDB has a variety of statements that let you configure and query a database. In this section, we'll look at the different types of statements that are available.

## Statement parameters

A number of parameters prefixed with `$` are automatically available within a statement that provide access to relevant context inside the statement. These are known as reserved variable names. For example:

* [$before](/docs/surrealql/parameters#before-after) and [$after](/docs/surrealql/parameters#before-after) can be accessed in statements that mutate values to see the values before and after an update,
* [$session](/docs/surrealql/parameters#session) provides context on the current session,
* [$parent](/docs/surrealql/parameters#parent-this) provides access to the value in a primary query while inside a subquery.

For a full list of these automatically generated parameters, see the [parameters](/docs/surrealql/parameters#reserved-variable-names) page.
