# `DEFINE DATABASE` statement

The `DEFINE DATABASE` statement allows you to instantiate a named database, enabling you to specify security and configuration options.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a root owner or editor, or namespace owner or editor before you can use the `DEFINE DATABASE` statement.
- [You must select your namespace](/docs/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE DATABASE` statement.

## Statement syntax

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE DATABASE [ OVERWRITE | IF NOT EXISTS ] @name [ COMMENT @string ]
```

## Example usage
Below shows how you can create a database using the DEFINE DATABASE statement.

```surql
-- Specify the namespace for the database
USE NS abcum;

-- Define database
DEFINE DATABASE app_vitalsense;
```

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause

<Since v="v1.3.0" />

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define a database only if it does not already exist. You should use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause when defining a database in SurrealDB if you want to ensure that the database is only created if it does not already exist. If the database already exists, the `DEFINE DATABASE` statement will return an error.

It's particularly useful when you want to safely attempt to define a database without manually checking its existence first.

On the other hand, you should not use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause when you want to ensure that the database definition is updated regardless of whether it already exists. In such cases, you might prefer using the `OVERWRITE` clause, which allows you to define a database and overwrite an existing one if it already exists, ensuring that the latest version of the definition is always in use.

```surql
-- Create a DATABASE if it does not already exist
DEFINE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS app_vitalsense;
```

## Using `OVERWRITE` clause

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

The `OVERWRITE` clause can be used to define a database and overwrite an existing one if it already exists. You should use the `OVERWRITE` clause when you want to modify an existing database definition. If the database already exists, the `DEFINE DATABASE` statement will overwrite the existing definition with the new one.

```surql
-- Create a DATABASE and overwrite if it already exists
DEFINE DATABASE OVERWRITE app_vitalsense;
```
