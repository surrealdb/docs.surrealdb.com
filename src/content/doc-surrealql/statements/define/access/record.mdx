# `DEFINE ACCESS ... TYPE RECORD`

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

A record access method allows accessing SurrealDB as a [record user](/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#record-users).

Record users allow SurrealDB to operate as a web database by offering mechanisms to define custom signin and signup logic as well as custom table and field permissions.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a [root, namespace or database user](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) before you can define a record access method.
- [You must select your namespace and database](/docs/surrealql/statements/use) before you can define a record access method.

## Statement syntax

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE ACCESS [ OVERWRITE | IF NOT EXISTS ] @name
  ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
    [ SIGNUP @expression ]
    [ SIGNIN @expression ]
    [ WITH JWT
      [ ALGORITHM @algorithm KEY @key | URL @url ]
      [ WITH ISSUER KEY @key ]
    ]
    [ WITH REFRESH ]
  [ AUTHENTICATE @expression ]
  [ DURATION
    [ FOR TOKEN @duration ]
    [ FOR SESSION @duration ]
  ]
```

## Example usage

Below shows how you can define record access using the `DEFINE ACCESS ... TYPE RECORD` statement.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS account ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
	SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass) )
	SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
	DURATION FOR TOKEN 15m, FOR SESSION 12h
;
```

### With JSON Web Token

Successful authentication with a record access method results in SurrealDB generating a JSON Web Token (JWT or, in the context of SurrealDB, just "token") that can be used until its expiration to authenticate as the record user without the need of providing any additional credentials. These tokens can also be issued by third parties and trusted by SurrealDB in order to allow for the authentication process to take place outside of SurrealDB, while the resulting access claims can be provided to SurrealDB inside of a token that it can trust. This feature is provided by the `WITH JWT` clause, which behaves similarly to [the JWT access method](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access/jwt).

Since the origin of the claims in the JWT is verified, those claims can be used within SurrealQL in order to provide table and field authorization through an external authenticator using OpenID Connect, OAuth or simply acting as a trusted issuer of a JWT. This can be done by leveraging table permissions to allow or disallow access depending on the values of the claims in the verified token. For example, these claims can be compared with the records in a table to only return those matching certain criteria.

Bear in mind that table and field permissions only apply to [record users](/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#record-users), which must use tokens that are verified by a `RECORD` access method. Access provided by namespace and database tokens defined in a `JWT` access method is equivalent to access from [system users](/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#system-users), which is above fine-grained permissions. When application users will be the ones directly authenticating with JWT, defining a `RECORD` access method `WITH JWT` is most likely the right choice.

Reference [the JWT access method](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access/jwt) documentation for additional information about how JWT tokens can be used in SurrealDB, including verification through [JWKS](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access/jwt#json-web-key-set-jwks).

The following example shows how record access with a token can be used to grant authorization either by verifying that the `id` claim in the token (which is used to populate the [`$auth`](/docs/surrealql/parameters#auth) reserved parameter) matches the record that is being queried from the `user` table or if the `privileged` claim is set to `true` in the token:

```surql
-- Specify the namespace and database for the token
USE NS abcum DB app_vitalsense;

DEFINE ACCESS token_name ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD WITH JWT

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----";

DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL
  -- Authorized users can select, update, delete and create user records
  PERMISSIONS FOR select, update, delete, create
  -- The access method must be "users"
  WHERE $access = "users"
  -- The record of the user being queried must match the one identified in the token
  -- Only matching records will be changed or returned
  AND id = $auth.id
  -- Allow privileged tokens to query any user
  OR $token.privileged = true
;
```

You may also use permissions clauses to perform additional verification on other JWT claims that may be required or recommended by the provider of the token, such as verifying that the `iss` claim matches a specific principal using `$token.iss`. However, this kind of logic may be better suited for the [`AUTHENTICATE`](#with-authenticate-clause) clause, which is only executed when the token is validated before an authenticated session is established instead of in every query and for each record.

The token payload should at least include the following claims when used to authenticate as a record user in SurrealDB.

```json title="JWT Payload"
{
  "exp": 2147483647,
  "ns": "abcum",
  "db": "app_vitalsense",
  "ac": "users",
  "id": "user:1"
}
```

When the `id` claim is present in the token, the fields of the record matching the identifier specified will be accessible through the `$auth` reserved parameter. For example, if the value of the `id` claim is `user:73q1bl039y6k8z80v55d`, and user records have fields such as “name” or “email”, then `$auth.name` and `$auth.email` can be used to access those values for the `user:73q1bl039y6k8z80v55d` record specifically, without them being present in the JWT.

#### With Issuer

When explicitly defining a way to verify tokens for record access, it is also possible to customize how these tokens are issued by SurrealDB. This allows specifying the algorithm and the signing key, which otherwise default to the HS512 algorithm with a randomly generated 128-character alphanumeric key. Configuring a record access method to sign tokens with specific signing credentials allows third party services to trust tokens issued by SurrealDB by trusting those signing credentials. In this way, an external service may rely on the signup and signin logic that has been implemented for record users in SurrealDB for its own authentication.

Currently, the algorithm for the issuer and the verifier are required to match. For this reason, the issuer algorithm can be omitted if it has already been defined in the `WITH JWT` clause. Likewise, an issuer does not need to be explicitly defined in the case where a key to verify JWT using a symmetric algorithm has already been defined in the `WITH JWT` clause, as the same key will also be used to sign the tokens.

The following is an example of defining a record access method that can issue tokens with an asymmetric key pair:

```surql

The issuer is implicitly defined when using a symmetric algorithm in `WITH JWT`:

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS token_name ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD WITH JWT
-- Symmetric algorithm with a symmetric key
-- The same key is used to sign and verify
ALGORITHM HS512 KEY "secret";
-- The following clause is implicit:
-- WITH ISSUER ALGORITHM HS512 KEY "secret"
```

### With refresh token

> [!CAUTION]
> Currently, the `WITH REFRESH` clause is an experimental feature intended to be used for validating its suitability and security. As such, it may be subject to breaking changes and may present unidentified security issues. Do not rely on this feature in production applications. To enable this and other experimental features related to bearer access, set the `SURREAL_EXPERIMENTAL_BEARER_ACCESS` [environment variable](/docs/surrealdb/cli/env) to `true`.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to changes required in the RPC API and the SDKs, refresh tokens are currently only available when signing up and in through the [HTTP REST API](/docs/surrealdb/integration/http).

Defining a record access method `WITH REFRESH` will result in an additional [bearer key](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access/bearer) for the record user being returned after successful authentication with the access method. This bearer key is intended to be used as a "refresh token", which is a concept commonly found in standards such as [OAuth 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.5).

Unlike authentication tokens (i.e. JWT), refresh tokens (i.e. bearer keys) feature randomly generated opaque strings that contain no authentication information by themselves, but rather a pointer to an access grant that is stored in the datastore. Also unlike authentication tokens, bearer keys such as refresh tokens can be [audited](/docs/surrealql/statements/access/#show) and [revoked](/docs/surrealql/statements/access/#revoke) using the [`ACCESS`](/docs/surrealql/statements/access) statement. Refresh tokens are automatically revoked and replaced by a new refresh token whenever used to obtain an authentication token, reducing the time window for exploiting a compromised refresh token. These additional security guarantees allow refresh tokens to be longer-lived than authentication tokens, which in turn encourages making the original authentication tokens as short-lived as technically possible.

By default, refresh tokens will expire after 30 days. However, their duration can be configured using the `DURATION FOR GRANT` clause, which will accept any duration. If set to `NONE`, refresh tokens will never expire. It is strongly recommended to set some expiration for refresh tokens to minimize the potential impact of credential stealing attacks.

Because refresh tokens can be used to indefinitely keep a user authenticated with SurrealDB as long as they are exchanged for a new fresh token before they expire, [special care](/docs/surrealdb/reference-guide/security-best-practices#token-storage) should be taken when storing and applications using them should be suitably protected from attacks.

Like other bearer keys, all refresh tokens are stored in the datastore even after they are expired or revoked. This means that using refresh tokens will have a space cost in addition to the performance cost of retrieving and verifying them against the datastore. Refresh tokens are intended to be used only to obtain a new authentication token after the existing one expires and applications should only use them when necessary, such as after receiving a [token expiration error](/docs/surrealdb/security/troubleshooting#token-expired-error). For certain high volume applications, you may want to regularly [purge](/docs/surrealql/statements/access/#purge) expired refresh tokens to minimize the space used by inactive refresh tokens.

For more information on how to manage existing refresh tokens, see the [`ACCESS`](/docs/surrealql/statements/access) statement.

#### Example: Signing in with a refresh token

Define a record access method `WITH REFRESH`:

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS user ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
	SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass) )
	SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
	WITH REFRESH
	DURATION FOR GRANT 15d, FOR TOKEN 1m, FOR SESSION 12h
;
```

Sign up with a new user or sign in with an existing user via the [HTTP REST API](/docs/surrealdb/integration/http):

```bash
curl -X POST \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-d '{"NS":"test", "DB":"test", "AC":"user", "name":"John Doe", "email":"john.doe@example.com", "pass":"VerySecurePassword!"}' \
	http://localhost:8000/signup
```

```json title="Response"

	"code":200,
	"details":"Authentication succeeded",
	"token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE3MzQ1MTkyODIsIm5iZiI6MTczNDUxOTI4MiwiZXhwIjoxNzM0NTE5MzQyLCJpc3MiOiJTdXJyZWFsREIiLCJqdGkiOiJiYzQ3MzhkOS0zMTM3LTQ1ZjMtOGUzMy1jMmJmODI0MzZlZTciLCJOUyI6InRlc3QiLCJEQiI6InRlc3QiLCJBQyI6InVzZXIiLCJJRCI6InVzZXI6dHZ2NWVreXNscjBsb21sNHp4aTkifQ.liEvoYuxk9EgzqBE5MzyG2IaJTJxazz-aD9vqWPGc5AGL2u0H0gggjX3jpcaBAIyU356wxNaxFrvCoTqaA4Vrg",
	"refresh":"surreal-refresh-UgYUNmB3FR8t-zdTZlFNuvdoWOtKe0Aqb1laH"
}
```

Sign in with the refresh token to obtain a new token and refresh token:

```bash
curl -X POST \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-d '{"NS":"test", "DB":"test", "AC":"user", "refresh":"surreal-refresh-UgYUNmB3FR8t-zdTZlFNuvdoWOtKe0Aqb1laH"}' \
	http://localhost:8000/signin
```

	"refresh":"surreal-refresh-MPKzHBtznxMa-pFJj2Doj2IRHApIzGmeOAcYo"
}
```

### With `AUTHENTICATE` clause

In the context of [`DEFINE ACCESS ... TYPE RECORD`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access/record),the authenticate clause can be used to change the record identifier returned by the `SIGNIN` and `SIGNUP` clauses or replace the identifier provided in the token when authenticating `WITH JWT`.

This clause can also be used to log or stop authentication attempts from record users, as it is always executed across signin, signup and token authentication.

Unlike the [`PERMISSIONS`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/table#defining-permissions) clause, the `AUTHENTICATE` clause is executed only at the time of authentication, resulting in increased performance for queries that only need to be validated at that point.

On the other hand, permissions queries are executed in every query and for each record, ensuring that any authorization conditions are verified at the time of the query. The `AUTHENTICATE` clause is a good fit for validating specific conditions that are not expected to change during the lifetime of the session such as the presence of any required token claims.

#### Example: External authentication providers

Replacing the record identifier that will be used to establish the session is especially useful in scenarios where the token used to authenticate the session does not contain one. This is common when using an external authentication provider, which may only have knowledge of generic user identifiers such as an email address or UUID.

In the below example, we check if the session may already be tied to an existing user by using the `$auth` reserved parameter, which contains the record identifier of the authenticated user. If we can select the `id` field from `$auth`, it means that the token already contained the `id` for a record that exists in the database. If that is not the case, we can check if the token contains a different claim that we can rely on to uniquely identifies users. In this case we check for an email address. If the `email` claim is present in the token, we try to retrieve the user from the `user` table by their email address. If none of the queries return a record, the `AUTHENTICATE` clause will fail with a generic error. You can also choose to `THROW` a custom error as shown in the next example.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS user ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
    WITH JWT ALGORITHM HS512 KEY 'secret'
    AUTHENTICATE {
        IF $auth.id {
            RETURN $auth.id;
        } ELSE IF $token.email {
            RETURN SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $token.email;
        };
    }
;
```

#### Example: Failing authentication

Because the `AUTHENTICATE` clause is always executed across signin, signup and token authentication, it is in a unique position to centralize logic after user credentials are deemed valid, but before the user is completely authenticated.

Below, we show an example of validating if a user is enabled. If this is not the case, we can `THROW` an error stating why the user cannot authenticate, stopping the authentication attempt with a custom message. You can also choose to not return anything, which results in a generic authentication error. If the user is enabled, we can `RETURN` the record identifier, which confirms that authentication is successful and specifies that the record user which will be authenticated in the session is the same that was already authenticated.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS user ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
    SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass), enabled = true )
    SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
    AUTHENTICATE {
        IF !$auth.enabled {
            THROW "This user is not enabled";
        };

        RETURN $auth;
    }
;
```

#### Example: Auditing and revoking tokens

In addition to what is shown in the previous example, the `AUTHENTICATE` clause can also be used to create records and access the claims found in the token itself using the `$token` reserved parameter. These features can be combined to log authentication attempts and stop authentication from completing if some conditions are met.

Below, we show a proof of concept example that leverages the fact that tokens issued by SurrealDB have the standard `jti` claim, which contains a randomly generated unique identifier for the token. This value can be used to uniquely identify each token that is issued by SurrealDB for the purposes of auditing and revocation.

In this example, we create a new record in the `token` table for each token that SurrealDB issues after a successful `SIGNIN` and `SIGNUP`. This record is identified by the value in the `jti`(JWT ID) claim. Every time that a token is used to authenticate, we check if the record in the `token` table with identifier matching the `jti`(JWT ID) claim has been revoked and, if so, we fail authentication with a custom message. Otherwise, we log the time that the token was used to successfully authenticate in the `audit` table and continue authentication without changes.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS user ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
    SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass) )
    SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
    AUTHENTICATE {
        IF type::thing("token", $token.jti).revoked = true {
            THROW "This token has been revoked";
        };
        INSERT INTO token { id: $token.jti, exp: $token.exp, revoked: false };
        CREATE audit CONTENT { token: $token.jti, time: time::now() };
        RETURN $auth;
    }
    DURATION FOR TOKEN 30d, FOR SESSION 1h
;
```

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define an access method of type RECORD only if it does not already exist. You should use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause when defining an access method in SurrealDB if you want to ensure that the access method is only created if it does not already exist. If the access method already exists, the `DEFINE ACCESS` statement will return an error.

It's particularly useful when you want to safely attempt to define an access method without manually checking its existence first.

```surql
-- Create a RECORD access method for the example database if it does not already exist
DEFINE ACCESS IF NOT EXISTS example ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD;
```

## Using `OVERWRITE` clause

The `OVERWRITE` clause can be used to define an access method of type RECORD and overwrite an existing one if it already exists. You should use the `OVERWRITE` clause when you want to modify an existing access method definition. If the access method already exists, the `DEFINE ACCESS` statement will overwrite the existing access method definition with the new one.

```surql
-- Create a RECORD access method for the example database and overwrite if it already exists
DEFINE ACCESS OVERWRITE example ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD;
```
