# `DEFINE SEQUENCE` statement

<Since v="v3.0.0-alpha.2" />

A sequence is used to generate reliable, monotonically increasing numeric sequences in both single-node and clustered SurrealDB deployments (multiple compute nodes backed by TiKV). It uses a batch-allocation strategy to minimise coordination while guaranteeing global uniqueness.

The key features of a sequence are as follows:

* Batch allocation: Nodes request ranges of sequence values at once, reducing network chatter and coordination overhead.
* Node ownership tagging: Every batch is tagged with the requesting node's UUID to prevent overlap between nodes.
* Durable Persistence: Sequence metadata is stored in the underlying key-value store to survive restarts and network partitions.
* Concurrent, thread-safe access: A DashMap caches active sequences, allowing lock-free reads on the hot path.
* Exponential back-off with full jitter: When a batch-allocation attempt fails, the node retries with an exponential delay that includes full jitter to avoid thundering-herd effects across the cluster.
* Automatic cleanup: Listens for namespace and database-removal events and purges the corresponding sequence state.

The sequence implementation avoids contention by having each node reserve a range of sequence values, allowing it to serve multiple requests locally without requiring distributed coordination for every request. When a node exhausts its allocated range, it acquires a new batch from the distributed store.

## Statement syntax

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE SEQUENCE [ OVERWRITE | IF NOT EXISTS ] @name [ BATCH @batch ] [ START @start ] [ TIMEOUT @duration ]
```

## Examples

A sequence can be created with nothing more than a name.

```surql
DEFINE SEQUENCE mySeq;
```

The `BATCH`, `START`, and 'TIMEOUT' clauses can be included to configure the sequence.

```surql
DEFINE SEQUENCE mySeq2 BATCH 1000 START 100 TIMEOUT 5s;
sequence::nextval('mySeq2');
-- Output: 100

DEFINE SEQUENCE mySeq3 BATCH 1000 START 100 TIMEOUT 0s;
sequence::nextval('mySeq2');
-- Output: 'The query was not executed because it exceeded the timeout'
```
