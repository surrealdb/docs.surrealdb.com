# `DEFINE USER` statement

Use the `DEFINE USER` statement to create system users on SurrealDB


> [!NOTE]
> While existing logins still function, the DEFINE LOGIN statement has been replaced with DEFINE USER.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated with a user that has enough permissions. Only the OWNER built-in role grants permissions to create users.
- You must be authenticated with a user that has permissions on the level where you are creating the user:
    - Root users with owner permissions can create Root, Namespace and Database users.
    - Namespace users with owner permissions can create Namespace and Database users
    - Database users with owner permissions can create Database users.
- To select the level where you want to create the user, [you may need to select a namespace and/or database](/docs/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE USER` statement for database or namespace tokens.


> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use the DEFINE USER statement to create a record user.

## Statement syntax

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE USER [ OVERWRITE | IF NOT EXISTS ] @name
	ON [ ROOT | NAMESPACE | DATABASE ]
	[ PASSWORD @pass | PASSHASH @hash ]
	[ ROLES @roles ]
	[ DURATION [ FOR TOKEN @duration [ , ] ] [ FOR SESSION @duration ] ]
  [ COMMENT @string ]
```

## Example usage
The following example shows how you can create a `ROOT` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```surql
-- Create the user with an owner role and some example durations
DEFINE USER username ON ROOT PASSWORD '123456' ROLES OWNER DURATION FOR SESSION 15m, FOR TOKEN 5s;
```
The following example shows how you can create a `NAMESPACE` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```surql
-- Specify the namespace
USE NS abcum;
-- Create the user with an editor role and some example durations
DEFINE USER username ON NAMESPACE PASSWORD '123456' ROLES EDITOR DURATION FOR SESSION 12h, FOR TOKEN 1m;
```

The following example shows how you can create a `DATABASE` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.
```surql
-- Specify the namespace and database for the user
USE NS abcum DB app_vitalsense;
-- Create the user with a viewer role and some example durations
DEFINE USER username ON DATABASE PASSWORD '123456' ROLES VIEWER DURATION FOR SESSION 5d, FOR TOKEN 2h;
```

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause

<Since v="v1.3.0" />

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define a user only if it does not already exist. You should use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause when defining a user in SurrealDB if you want to ensure that the user is only created if it does not already exist. If the user already exists, the `DEFINE USER` statement will return an error.

It's particularly useful when you want to safely attempt to define a user without manually checking its existence first.

On the other hand, you should not use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause when you want to ensure that the user definition is updated regardless of whether it already exists. In such cases, you might prefer using the `OVERWRITE` clause, which allows you to define a user and overwrite an existing one if it already exists, ensuring that the latest version of the user definition is always in use

```surql
-- Create a USER if it does not already exist
DEFINE USER IF NOT EXISTS example ON ROOT PASSWORD "example" ROLES OWNER;
```

## Using `OVERWRITE` clause

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

The `OVERWRITE` clause can be used to define a user and overwrite an existing one if it already exists. You should use the `OVERWRITE` clause when you want to modify an existing user definition. If the user already exists, the `DEFINE USER` statement will overwrite the existing user definition with the new one.

```surql
-- Create an USER and overwrite if it already exists
DEFINE USER OVERWRITE example ON ROOT PASSWORD "example" ROLES OWNER;
```

## Roles
Currently, only the built-in roles OWNER, EDITOR and VIEWER are available.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Role</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>OWNER</td>
    <td>Can view and edit any resource on the user's level or below, including user and token (IAM) resources.<br/>It also grants full permissions for child resources that support the `PERMISSIONS` clause (tables, fields, etc.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>EDITOR</td>
    <td>Can view and edit any resource on the user's level or below, but not users or token (IAM) resources<br/>It also grants full permissions for child resources that support the `PERMISSIONS` clause (tables, fields, etc.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VIEWER</td>
    <td>Grants permissions to view any resource on the user's level or below, but not edit.<br/>It also grants view permissions for child resources that support the `PERMISSIONS` clause (tables, fields, etc.)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Duration
<Since v="v2.0.0" />

The duration clause specifies the duration of the token returned after successful authentication with a password or passhash as well as the duration of the session established both using a password or passhash and the aforementioned token. The difference between these concepts is explained in the [expiration](/docs/surrealdb/security/authentication#expiration) documentation.
