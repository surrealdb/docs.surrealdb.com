# `SHOW` statement

The `SHOW` statement can be used to replay changes made to a table.

## Requirements
- You must first [`DEFINE`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/table#example-usage) a [Change Feed](https://surrealdb.com/products/change-data-capture).

### Statement syntax

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE @tablename
	SINCE @timestamp | @versionstamp
	[ LIMIT @number ]
```

## Example usage

### Basic usage

The following expression shows usage of the SHOW statement.

```surql
-- Define the change feed and its duration
DEFINE TABLE reading CHANGEFEED 3d;

-- Create some records in the reading table
CREATE reading SET story = "Once upon a time";
CREATE reading SET story = "there was a database";

-- Replay changes to the reading table since a date
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE d"2023-09-07T01:23:52Z" LIMIT 10;
-- Replay changes to the reading table since a versionstamp
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE 1 LIMIT 10;
```

Assuming the datetime above matches with the one when the changefeed was established, the response for both queries will be as follows.

```surql title="Response"
[
	{
		changes: [
			{
				define_table: {
					name: 'reading'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 65536
	},
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:bavjgpnhkgvudfg4mg16,
					story: 'Once upon a time'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 131072
	},
	{
		changes: [
			{
				update: {
					id: reading:liq4e7hzjaw7bp5t4pn1,
					story: 'there was a database'
				}
			}
		],
		versionstamp: 196608
	}
]
```

Note the following when working with the versionstamps of a changefeed:

* Changefeeds defined on tables are implemented via a single `CHANGEFEED` on the database level. As such, `SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE sometable` will only show versionstamps in sequential order if `sometable` is the database's only table.
* The `versionstamp` output above is due to an extra two bytes needed for more detailed ordering needed in the FoundationDB distributed [SurrealDB backend](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture). To turn these versionstamps into a normal sequence of numbers, a right shift of sixteen bits (`>> 16`) can be used.
* A `SINCE <number` greater than the current sequential number will return an empty array.
* `SINCE <time>` needs to be a datetime after which the `CHANGEFEED` was defined.

Versionstamps carry the following two guarantees:

* Versionstamps monotonically increase.
* Versionstamp format is universal across various backends.
