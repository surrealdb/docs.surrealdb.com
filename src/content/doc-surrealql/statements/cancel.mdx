# `CANCEL` statement

Each statement within SurrealDB is run within its own transaction. If a set of changes need to be made together, then groups of statements can be run together as a single transaction, either succeeding as a whole, or failing without leaving any residual data modifications. While a transaction will fail if any of its statements encounters an error, the `CANCEL` statement can also be used to cancel a transaction manually.

### Statement syntax

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
CANCEL [ TRANSACTION ];
```

## Example usage

The following query shows example usage of this statement.

```surql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Setup accounts
CREATE account:one SET balance = 135605.16;
CREATE account:two SET balance = 91031.31;

-- Move money
UPDATE account:one SET balance += 300.00;
UPDATE account:two SET balance -= 300.00;

-- Rollback all changes
CANCEL TRANSACTION;
```

`CANCEL` is not used to automatically cancel a transaction based on a condition such as inside an [IF..ELSE](/docs/surrealql/statements/ifelse) block. Instead, a [THROW](/docs/surrealql/statements/throw) statement is used. THROW can be followed by any value, usually a string containing context behind the error.

```surql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Setup accounts
CREATE account:one SET balance = 135605.16;
CREATE account:two SET balance = 200.31;

-- Move money
UPDATE account:one SET balance += 300.00;
UPDATE account:two SET balance -= 300.00;

IF account:two.balance < 0 {
    THROW "Not enough funds";
};

COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```
