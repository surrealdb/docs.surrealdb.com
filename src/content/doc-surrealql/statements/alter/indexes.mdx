## ALTER INDEX PREPARE REMOVE

<Since v="v3.0.0-alpha.17" />

As the name implies, an `ALTER INDEX PREPARE REMOVE` statement alters an index to prepare it for removal. This statement sets up a step in which the index has been decommissioned (prepared for removal), but not yet removed. At this point, `SELECT` queries along with the `EXPLAIN` clause to monitor query performance without the index.

```surql
-- 1. Decommission the index
ALTER INDEX my_index ON my_table PREPARE REMOVE;

-- 2. Monitor query performance and verify queries still work
SELECT ... FROM my_table EXPLAIN;

-- 3. If satisfied, permanently remove the index
REMOVE INDEX my_index ON my_table;
```

If removing the index is no longer desired, it can be restored to a useful state by using a [REBUILD INDEX](/docs/surrealql/statements/rebuild) statement.

```surql
REBUILD INDEX my_index ON my_table;
```
