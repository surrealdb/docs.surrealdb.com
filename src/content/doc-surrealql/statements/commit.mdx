description: The COMMIT statement is used to commit a set of statements within a transaction, ensuring that all data modifications become a permanent part of the database.

# `COMMIT` statement

Each statement within SurrealDB is run within its own transaction by default. If a set of changes need to be made together, then groups of statements can be run together as a single transaction, either succeeding as a whole, or failing without leaving any residual data modifications. A `COMMIT` statement is used at the end of such a transaction to make the data modifications a permanent part of the database.

### Statement syntax

import RailroadDiagram from "@components/RailroadDiagram.astro";
import Tabs from "@components/Tabs/Tabs.astro";
import TabItem from "@components/Tabs/TabItem.astro";

<Tabs syncKey="commit-statement">
  <TabItem label="SurrealQL Syntax">

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
COMMIT [ TRANSACTION ];
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Railroad Diagram">

export const commitAst = {
  type: "Diagram",
  padding: [10, 20, 10, 20],
  children: [
    {
      type: "Sequence",
      children: [
        { type: "Terminal", text: "COMMIT" },
        { type: "Optional", child: { type: "Terminal", text: "TRANSACTION" } },
        { type: "Terminal", text: ";" },
      ],
    },
  ],
};

## Example usage

The following query shows example usage of this statement.

```surql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Setup accounts
CREATE account:one SET balance = 135605.16;
CREATE account:two SET balance = 91031.31;

-- Move money
UPDATE account:one SET balance += 300.00;
UPDATE account:two SET balance -= 300.00;

-- Finalise all changes
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

The following two options can be used at any point if a transaction must be cancelled without commiting the changes:

* [CANCEL](/docs/surrealql/statements/cancel) to manually cancel the transaction.
* [THROW](/docs/surrealql/statements/throw) to cancel a transaction with an optional error message. THROW is the only way to cancel a transaction based on a condition, such as inside an [IF..ELSE](/docs/surrealql/statements/ifelse) block.

In addition, a `RETURN` statement can be used to return early from a successful transaction. This is often used in order to return a customized output.

```surql
BEGIN;

CREATE account:one SET balance = 135605.16;
CREATE account:two SET balance = 91031.31, wants_to_send_money = true;

IF !account:two.wants_to_send_money {
    THROW "Customer doesn't want to send any money!";
};

LET $first = UPDATE ONLY account:one SET balance += 300.00;
LET $second = UPDATE ONLY account:two SET balance -= 300.00;

RETURN "Money sent! Status:\n" + <string>$first + '\n' + <string>$second;

COMMIT;
```

```surql title="Output"
'Money sent! Status:
{ balance: 135905.16f, id: account:one }
{ balance: 90731.31f, id: account:two, wants_to_send_money: true }'
```
