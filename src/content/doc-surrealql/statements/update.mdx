# `UPDATE` statement

The `UPDATE` statement can be used to update existing records in the database. If the record does not exist, the statement will fail and no records will be updated.


> [!NOTE]
> This statement can not be used to create graph relationships. For that, use the [`RELATE`](/docs/surrealql/statements/relate) statement.

### Statement syntax

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
UPDATE [ ONLY ] @targets
	[ CONTENT @value
	  | MERGE @value
	  | PATCH @value
	  | [ SET @field = @value, ... | UNSET @field, ... ]
	]
	[ WHERE @condition ]
	[ RETURN NONE | RETURN BEFORE | RETURN AFTER | RETURN DIFF | RETURN @statement_param, ... ]
	[ TIMEOUT @duration ]
	[ PARALLEL ]
;
```

> [!NOTE]
> `@target` refers to either record output including an `id` field, or a [record ID](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/ids) on its own.

## Example usage

The following query shows example usage of this statement.

> [!NOTE]
> In the case where the record ID doesn't exist, the statement will fail and no records will be updated. Be sure to create the record using the [`CREATE`](/docs/surrealql/statements/create) statement before updating it. Alternatively, you can use the [`UPSERT`](/docs/surrealql/statements/upsert) statement to create the record if it doesn't exist.

Let's look at some examples of how to use the `UPDATE` statement: First we'll create a `person` table with the [`CREATE`](/docs/surrealql/statements/create) Statement so that the examples can be run.

```surql
-- Create a Schemaless person table
CREATE person CONTENT {
    name: 'John',
    company: 'Surrealist',
    skills: ['JavaScript', 'Go' , 'SurrealQL']
};
```

Let's say we wanted to update the `person` table with a new field `skills` and add a new skill `breathing` to the existing skills.

To do this we would use the following query:

```surql
-- Update all records in a table
-- The skills field is an array. The += operator alone is enough for SurrealDB to infer the type
UPDATE person SET skills += 'breathing';
```
The above query will update all records in the `person` table by adding the skill `breathing` to the `skills` field.

For more specific updates, you can specify a record ID to update a single record. The following query will create the record with the ID `person:tobie` :

```surql
CREATE person:tobie CONTENT {
    name: 'Tobie',
    company: 'SurrealDB',
    skills: ['JavaScript', 'Go' , 'SurrealQL']
};
```

Next, you can update the record with the ID `person:tobie` to add "Rust" as a skill, using the following query:

```surql
-- Update a record with a specific string id to add a new skill: 'Rust'
UPDATE person:tobie SET skills = ['JavaScript', 'Go' , 'SurrealQL','Rust'];
```

> [!NOTE]
> When specifying fields to update using the `SET` clause, it is possible to increment and decrement numeric values, and add or remove values from arrays. To increment a numeric value, or to add an item to an array, use the `+=` operator. To decrement a numeric value, or to remove a value from an array, use the `-=` operator.

```surql
-- Update a document and remove a tag from skills array
UPDATE person:tobie SET skills -= 'Go';
```

You can also remove a field from a record using the `UNSET` keyword or by setting the field to `NONE`.

```surql
-- Remove the company field by setting it to NONE or using the UNSET keyword
UPDATE person:tobie SET company = NONE;

UPDATE person:tobie UNSET company;
```

## Conditional Update with `WHERE` clause

The `UPDATE` statement supports conditional matching of records using a `WHERE` clause. If the expression in the `WHERE` clause evaluates to true, then the respective record will be updated.

```surql
-- Update all records which match the condition
UPDATE person SET skills += "System design" WHERE company = "SurrealDB";
```
Instead of specifying record data using the `SET` clause, it is also possible to use the `CONTENT` keyword to specify the record data using a SurrealQL object.

```surql
-- Update all records with the same content
UPDATE person CONTENT {
	name: 'Tobie',
	company: 'SurrealDB',
	skills: ['Rust', 'Go', 'JavaScript'],
};

-- Update a specific record with some content
UPDATE person:tobie CONTENT {
	name: 'Tobie',
	company: 'SurrealDB',
	skills: ['Rust', 'Go', 'JavaScript'],
};
```

## MERGE clause
Instead of specifying the full record data using the `SET` clause or the `CONTENT` keyword, it is also possible to merge-update only specific fields by using the `MERGE` keyword and specifying only the fields which are to be updated.

```surql
-- Update certain fields on all records
UPDATE person MERGE {
	settings: {
		marketing: true,
	},
};

-- Update certain fields on a specific record
UPDATE person:tobie MERGE {
	settings: {
		marketing: true,
	},
};
```

You can also specify changes to be applied to your query response, using the PATCH command which works similar to the [JSON Patch specification](https://jsonpatch.com/)

```surql
-- Patch the JSON response
UPDATE person:tobie PATCH [
	{
		"op": "add",
		"path": "Engineering",
		"value": "true"
	}
]
```

## Bulk update

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

The `UPDATE` statement supports bulk update, which allows multiple records to be updated in a single query. The `@value` part of `CONTENT` and `MERGE` clause can be either a single object or an array of objects.

```surql
UPDATE person CONTENT [
   {id: r"person:jaime", name: "Jaime", surname: "Morgan Hitchcock"},
   {id: "tobie", name: "Tobie", surname: "Morgan Hitchcock"},
   ... 1000 more records
]
```

## Alter the `RETURN` value

By default, the update statement returns the record value once the changes have been made. To change the return value of each record, specify a `RETURN` clause, specifying either `NONE`, `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, `DIFF`, or a comma-separated list of specific fields to return.

```surql
-- Don't return any result
UPDATE person SET skills += 'reading' RETURN NONE;

-- Return the changeset diff
UPDATE person SET skills += 'reading' RETURN DIFF;

-- Return the record before changes were applied
UPDATE person SET skills += 'reading' RETURN BEFORE;

-- Return the record after changes were applied (the default)
UPDATE person SET skills += 'reading' RETURN AFTER;

-- Return a specific field only from the updated records
UPDATE person:tobie SET skills = ['skiing', 'music'] RETURN name, interests;
```
When processing a large result set with many interconnected records, it is possible to use the `TIMEOUT` keywords to specify a timeout duration for the statement. If the statement continues beyond this duration, then the transaction will fail, no records will be updated in the database, and the statement will return an error.

```surql
UPDATE person:tobie SET important = true WHERE ->knows->person->(knows WHERE influencer = true) TIMEOUT 5s;
```
