# `ALTER` statement

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

The `ALTER` statement can be used to change definitions for defined resources.

> \[!NOTE]
> Currently, the `ALTER` statement only supports modifying tables and their properties - `ALTER TABLE`, but will be expanded to include other resources. In the meantime, the `OVERWRITE` clause can be used in other `DEFINE` statements to redefine resources that have already been defined.

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
ALTER [
	| TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] @name
		[ DROP ]
		[ SCHEMAFULL | SCHEMALESS ]
		[ PERMISSIONS [ NONE | FULL
			| FOR select @expression
			| FOR create @expression
			| FOR update @expression
			| FOR delete @expression
		] ]
    [ COMMENT @string ]
]
```

## Modify a table schema

When starting a new project, you may require a table to be schemaless to allow for flexibility in the data structure. However, as the project progresses, you may want to lock down the schema to prevent new fields from being added. This can be done using the `ALTER` statement.

> \[!NOTE]
> To see the already defined items that can be modified with `ALTER`, use the [INFO](/docs/surrealql/statements/info) statement (`INFO FOR ROOT`, `INFO FOR NAMESPACE`, or `INFO FOR DATABASE`).

An example of `ALTER` to modify an existing table:

```surql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMALESS;
DEFINE FIELD name ON TABLE user TYPE string;
CREATE user SET name = "LordofSalty";

-- Now make it schemafull to ensure that no other fields can be used
ALTER TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;
```

## Modify table permissions

You can also use the `ALTER` statement to change a table's permissions. An `ALTER` statement only needs to include the items to be altered, not the entire definition.

```surql
-- Will show up as DEFINE TABLE user TYPE ANY SCHEMAFULL PERMISSIONS NONE
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL;

-- Now defined as DEFINE TABLE user TYPE ANY SCHEMAFULL PERMISSIONS FULL
ALTER TABLE user PERMISSIONS FOR create FULL;
```

## Using `IF EXISTS` clause

You can use the' IF EXISTS' clause to prevent an error from occurring when trying to alter a table that does not exist.

```surql
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS user SCHEMAFULL;
```
