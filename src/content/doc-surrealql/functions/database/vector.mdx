# Vector functions

A collection of essential vector operations that provide foundational functionality for numerical computation, machine learning, and data analysis. These operations include distance measurements, similarity coefficients, and other basic and complex operations related to vectors. Through understanding and implementing these functions, we can perform a wide variety of tasks ranging from data processing to advanced statistical analyses.
