# `SPLIT` clause

The `SPLIT` clause in SurrealQL is used to split the results of a query based on a specific field, particularly when dealing with arrays. This is useful in scenarios where you want to treat each element of an array as a separate row in the result set. It can be particularly helpful in data analysis contexts where you need to work with individual elements of an array separately.

## Syntax

```syntax title="Clause Syntax"
SPLIT [ON] @field
```

Suppose you have a user table with a field emails that contains an array of email addresses for each user. You want to list each email address as a separate record.

Here's how you can use the SPLIT clause in SurrealQL:

```surql
CREATE user SET
    name = "John Doe",
    emails = ["john@example.com", "doe@example.com"];


-- Split the results by each value in the emails array
SELECT * FROM user SPLIT emails;
```

Explanation:
- `CREATE user SET ...`: This creates a user record with a name and an array of email addresses.
- `SELECT * FROM user SPLIT emails`: This query selects all fields from the user table and splits the results based on the emails field. Each email address in the emails array is returned as a separate row in the result set.

Output:
The output of the query will be:

```json
[
    {
        "emails": "john@example.com",
        "id": "user:some_id",
        "name": "John Doe"
    },
    {
        "emails": "doe@example.com",
        "id": "user:some_id",
        "name": "John Doe"
    }
]
```
