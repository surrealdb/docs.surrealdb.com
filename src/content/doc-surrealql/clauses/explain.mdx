# `EXPLAIN` clause

The `EXPLAIN` clause is used to explain the query plan of a query. It is particularly useful when you want to understand how a query is executed and how it is optimized by the database.

When `EXPLAIN` is used, the statement returns an explanation, essentially revealing the execution plan to provide transparency and understanding of the query performance.
## Syntax

```syntax title="Clause Syntax"
@query EXPLAIN [FULL]
```

Using the `EXPLAIN` clause in addition to the `FULL` keyword is expeciallly useful when you want to understand the performance of a query and can provide more details when debugging.

## Examples

For example, consider the performance of the following query when the field `email` is not indexed. We can see that the execution plan will iterate over the whole table.

```surql title="Index not used"
CREATE person:tobie SET
	name = "Tobie",
	address = "1 Bagshot Row",
	email = "tobie@surrealdb.com";

SELECT * FROM person WHERE email='tobie@surrealdb.com' EXPLAIN;
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email='tobie@surrealdb.com' EXPLAIN FULL;
```

```surql title="Output"
-------- Query --------

[
	{
		detail: {
			table: 'person'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Table'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			type: 'Memory'
		},
		operation: 'Collector'
	}
]

-------- Query --------

[
	{
		detail: {
			table: 'person'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Table'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			type: 'Memory'
		},
		operation: 'Collector'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			count: 1
		},
		operation: 'Fetch'
	}
]

```

On the other hand, here is the result when the field `email` is indexed. We can see that the execution plan will use the index to retrieve the record.

```surql title="Index used"
DEFINE INDEX fast_email ON TABLE person FIELDS email;

CREATE person:tobie SET
	name = "Tobie",
	address = "1 Bagshot Row",
	email = "tobie@surrealdb.com";

SELECT * FROM person WHERE email='tobie@surrealdb.com' EXPLAIN;
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email='tobie@surrealdb.com' EXPLAIN FULL;    
```

```surql title="Output"
-------- Query --------

[
	{
		detail: {
			plan: {
				index: 'fast_email',
				operator: '=',
				value: 'tobie@surrealdb.com'
			},
			table: 'person'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Index'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			type: 'Memory'
		},
		operation: 'Collector'
	}
]

-------- Query --------

[
	{
		detail: {
			plan: {
				index: 'fast_email',
				operator: '=',
				value: 'tobie@surrealdb.com'
			},
			table: 'person'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Index'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			type: 'Memory'
		},
		operation: 'Collector'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			count: 1
		},
		operation: 'Fetch'
	}
]
