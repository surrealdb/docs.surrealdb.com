# Durations

A `duration` represents a non-negative period of time.

## Duration units

Durations can be specified in any of the following units:

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th scope="col">Unit</th>
        <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">ns</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Nanoseconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">us</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Microseconds, alternative: µs</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">ms</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Milliseconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">s</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Seconds</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">m</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Minutes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">h</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Hours</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">d</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Days</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">w</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Weeks</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Type">y</td>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Description">Years</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Creating and using durations

A duration can be composed of any number of duration units.

```surql
1y40w20h;
```

A duration that contains multiple instances of the same unit type will parse as well, combining lesser units into greater units when a maximum value is reached.

For example, a duration that includes `12h` two times will be evaluated as `1d`.

```surql
1d1d12h12h;
-- 3d
```

A duration can also be created by casting a string.

```surql
<duration>"1d1d12h12h";
-- 3d
```

A duration can be zero, but cannot be negative.

```surql
0ns;
0d; -- Evaluates to 0ns
```

The maximum possible duration can be accessed via the const [`duration::max`](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/duration#durationmax), above which a duration cannot be formed.

```surql
duration::max;
-- 584942417355y3w5d7h15s999ms999µs999ns

duration::max + 1ns
-- 'Failed to compute: "584942417355y3w5d7h15s999ms999µs999ns + 1ns", as the operation results in an arithmetic overflow.'
```

Durations can be added to and subtracted from other durations as well as datetimes.

```surql
d'1970-01-01' + 1d;
-- d'1970-01-02T00:00:00Z'

1y - 6w;
46w1d;
```

## Multiplying and dividing durations

<Since v="v3.0.1" />

A duration can be multiplied and divided by a number.

```surql
1d / 24;
-- 1h

1d * 5.5;
-- 5d12h
```
