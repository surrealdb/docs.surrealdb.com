# Objects

An object is a collection of named fields and values.

As a record is essentially an object with a required [`id` field](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/ids) that can be created, updated, or deleted, they can be worked with in almost exactly the same way as a standalone object.

A field of an object can be of any value type, including another object, with no limit to the depth of any nested objects or values within. This allows objects and arrays tno be stored within each other in order to model complex data scenarios.

```surql
CREATE person SET metadata = {
	interest_level: 83.67,
	information: {
		age: 23,
		gender: 'm',
	},
	marketing: true,
	activities: [
		"clicked link",
		"contact form",
		"read email",
		"viewed website",
		"viewed website",
		"viewed website",
		"read email",
	]
};
```

## Field names

### Valid field names

Similar to record IDs, field names can be constructed from ASCII characters, underscores, and numbers. To create a field name with complex characters, backticks can be used.

```surql
CREATE ONLY user SET my_name = 'name';
CREATE ONLY user SET `mi_nómine😊` = 'name';
```

```surql title="Output"
-------- Query --------

{
	id: user:nronupvxvdm7r1n5hlzm,
	my_name: 'name'
}

-------- Query 2 --------

{
	id: user:eb5pu7u9g67dy773hsv9,
	"mi_nómine😊": 'name'
}
```

Inside a standalone object, non-ASCII field names can also be set by using a string.

```surql
SELECT * FROM ONLY {
    "mi_nómine": "name"
};
```

```surql title="Output"
{
	"mi_nómine": 'name'
}
```

### Automatically generated field names

A field created from an operation will have a field name that represents the operation(s) used to construct it.

```surql
SELECT
    math::mean(temps),
    [ math::min(temps), math::max(temps) ]
FROM { temps: [-5, 8, 9] };
```

```surql title="Output"
[
    {
        "[math::min(temps), math::max(temps)]": [
            -5,
            9
        ],
        "math::mean": 4
    }
]
```

Using `AS` allows these automatically calculated field names to be replaced with custom names.

```surql
SELECT
    math::mean(temps) AS mean_temps,
    [ math::min(temps), math::max(temps) ] AS avg_temps
FROM { temps: [-5, 8, 9] };
```

```surql title="Output"
[
    {
        "avg_temps": [
            -5,
            9
        ],
        "mean_temps": 4
    }
]
```
