# None and null

SurrealDB uses two types called `None` and `Null` to represent two different ways in which data may not exist. While these may appear similar, they have different meanings and are used in different contexts.

## None values

`None` is used to denote that "something does not exist", for example, a field which is not present on a record.
Because of this, values of `None` can not be stored within records, meaning uses of `None` are typically limited to SurrealQL statements
where it is used to denote a value or response that does not exist.

### Example

Setting a record field to `None` is analogous to using `UNSET` to remove the field entirely.

```surql
UPDATE person SET children = NONE;
```

While it may appear that `None` is being written to the `children` field, what is actually happening is that the `children` field is being removed from the record.

```surql
SELECT * FROM person; -- Returns { id: person:2cz8rj0dc4tktxlkjquc }
```

## Null values

`Null` values are used to denote that "something exists, but has no value". This is useful when a field is present on a record, but the value of that field is unknown or not applicable. Unlike `None`, `Null` is written into records and can be stored as a value.

### Example

Setting a record field to `Null` will create the field on the record, but denotes that the field is considered empty.

```surql
UPDATE person SET children = null;
```

In this example, the `children` field is present on the record, but the value of that field is `null`.

```surql
SELECT * FROM person; -- Returns { id: person:2cz8rj0dc4tktxlkjquc, children: null }
```

## When to use None or Null

How you use `None` or `Null` is largely dependent on the context in which you are working.

If you are writing SurrealQL and need to denote something that does not exist, such as the absence of a field, use `None`.

If you are working with data and need to represent a value which is empty, use `Null`.
