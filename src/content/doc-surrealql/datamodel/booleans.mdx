# Booleans

Boolean values can be used to mark whether a field is `true` or `false`.

```surql
CREATE person SET newsletter = false, interested = true;
```

Many SurrealDB operators and functions return booleans.

```surql
CREATE person SET 
    name = "Billy", 
    name_is_billy = name = "Billy",
    name_is_long = string::len(name) > 10;
```

```surql title="Response"
[
    {
        "id": "person:8ii7v7f54a2m1rla1y6b",
        "name": "Billy",
        "name_is_billy": true,
        "name_is_long": false
    }
]
```

Boolean values can be written in anycase.

```surql
CREATE person SET 
    newsletter = FALSE,
    interested = True,
    very_interested = trUE;
```

## Booleans in `WHERE` clauses

When performing a query on the database, accessing a record's ID directly or using a [record range](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/ids#record-ranges) allows performance to be significantly sped up by avoiding the table scan which is used when a `WHERE` clause is included.

However, if a `WHERE` clause is unavoidable, performance can still be improved by simplifying the portion after the clause as much as possible. As a boolean is the simplest possible datatype, having a boolean field that can be used in a `WHERE` clause can significantly improve performance compared to a more complex operation.

```surql
-- Fill up the database a bit with 10,000 records
CREATE |person:10000| SET
    random_data = rand::string(1000),
    data_length = random_data.len(),
    is_short = data_length < 10 RETURN NONE;
-- Add one outlier
CREATE person:one SET
    random_data = "HI!",
    data_length = random_data.len(),
    is_short = data_length < 10 RETURN NONE;

-- Function call + compare operation: slowest
SELECT * FROM person WHERE random_data.len() < 10;
-- Compare operation: much faster
SELECT * FROM person WHERE data_length < 10;
-- Boolean check: even faster
SELECT * FROM person WHERE is_short;
-- Direct record access: almost instantaneous
SELECT * FROM person:one;
```
