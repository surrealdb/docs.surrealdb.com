# Arrays

An array is a collection of values contained inside `[]` (square brackets), each of which is stored at a certain index. Individual indexes and slices of indexes can be accesses using the same square bracket syntax.

```surql
-- Return a full array
RETURN [1,2,3,4,5];
-- Return the first ("zeroeth") item
RETURN [1,2,3,4,5][0];
-- Return indexes 0 to 2 of an array
RETURN [1,2,3,4,5][0..=2];
```

```surql title="Output"
-------- Query 2 (200µs) --------

[
	1,
	2,
	3,
	4,
	5
]

-------- Query 3 (99.999µs) --------

1

-------- Query 4 (100.001µs) --------

[
	1,
	2,
	3
]
```

Working with arrays is one of the most important skills when working with SurrealDB, as [`SELECT`](/docs/surrealql/statements/select) statements return an array of values by default unless the `ONLY` keyword is used on an array that contains a single item.

```surql
-- Even this returns an array
SELECT * FROM 9;
-- Use the `ONLY` clause to return a single item
SELECT * FROM ONLY 9;
-- Error: array has more than one item
SELECT * FROM ONLY [1,9];
```

```surql title="Output"
-------- Query 1  --------

[
	9
]

-------- Query 2 --------

9

-------- Query 3 --------

'Expected a single result output when using the ONLY keyword'
```

Similar to Object-based Record IDs, records in SurrealDB can store arrays of values, with no limit to the depth of the arrays. Arrays can store any value stored within them, and can store different value types within the same array.

```surql
CREATE person SET results = [
	{ score: 76, date: "2017-06-18T08:00:00Z", name: "Algorithmics" },
	{ score: 83, date: "2018-03-21T08:00:00Z", name: "Concurrent Programming" },
	{ score: 69, date: "2018-09-17T08:00:00Z", name: "Advanced Computer Science 101" },
	{ score: 73, date: "2019-04-20T08:00:00Z", name: "Distributed Databases" },
];
```

A maximum number of items can be specified for an array.

```surql
DEFINE FIELD employees ON TABLE team TYPE array<record<employee>, 5>;
CREATE team SET employees = [
	employee:one, 
	employee:two, 
	employee:three, 
	employee:four, 
	employee:five, 
	employee:doesnt_belong
];
```

```surql title="Response"
'Expected a array<record<employee>, 5> but the array had 6 items'
```

## Mapping and filtering on arrays

The `[]` operator after an array can also be used to filter the items inside an array. The parameter `$this` is used to refer to each individual item, while `WHERE` (or its alias `?`, a question mark) is used to set the condition for the item to pass the filter.

```surql
[true, false, true][WHERE $this = true];
```

```surql title="Output"
[true, true]
```

If a `WHERE` or `?` clause finds an item that by itself is not equal to `true` or `false`, it will check the item's [truthiness](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/values#values-and-truthiness) to determine whether to pass it on or not.

```surql
[1,2,NONE][? $this];

-- [1,2]
```

Filtering can be repeated if desired.

```surql
[
    {
        name: "Boston",
        population: NONE,
        first_mayor: "John Phillips"
    },
    {
        name: "Smurfville",
        population: 55,
        first_mayor: "Papa Smurf"
    },
    {
        name: "Harrisburg",
        population: 50183,
        first_mayor: NONE
    }
][WHERE $this.population]
 [WHERE $this.first_mayor];
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		first_mayor: 'Papa Smurf',
		name: 'Smurfville',
		population: 55
	}
]
```

## Sets

A `set` is a subtype of an array, identical in all respects except that the values inside it are automatically deduplicated.

```surql
RETURN <set>[1,1,2];

-- Returns [1,2]
```

As such, a field defined as a `set` can take an `array` as its input and vice versa. This next example shows the [`object::keys()`](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/object#objectkeys) function, which returns an array, used to populate a field defined as an `option<set<string>>`.

```surql
DEFINE FIELD suits ON TABLE hand TYPE option<set<string>> VALUE object::keys(cards);

CREATE hand SET cards = {
    clubs: [
        "queen", "10"
    ],
    hearts: [
        "jack", "2"    
    ],
    spades: [
        
    ],
    diamonds: [
        "king"
    ]
};
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		cards: {
			clubs: [
				'queen',
				'10'
			],
			diamonds: [
				'king'
			],
			hearts: [
				'jack',
				'2'
			],
			spades: []
		},
		id: hand:1jjihflcim7iisi7z55x,
		suits: [
			'clubs',
			'diamonds',
			'hearts',
			'spades'
		]
	}
]
```

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

## Filtering and mapping with array functions

SurrealDB also includes a number of methods for arrays that make it easier to filter and map. These methods take a closure (an anonymous function) that works in a similar way to the `$this` parameter above.

Here is an example of the `array::filter()` method being used in contrast to the classic `WHERE` syntax. Note that the parameter name inside the closure is named by the user, so `$val` in the example below could be `$v` or `$some_val` or anything else.

```surql
[1,3,5].filter(|$val| $val > 2);
[1,3,5][WHERE $this > 2];

-- [3,5]
```

While the [array functions](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/array) section of the documentation contains the full details of each function, the following examples provide a glimpse into how they are commonly used.

The [`array::map()`](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/array#arraymap) function provides access to each item in an array, allowing an opearation to be performed on it before being passed on.

```surql
[1,2,3].map(|$item| $item + 1);

-- [2,3,4]
```

If desired, a second parameter can be passed in that holds the index of the item.

```surql
[1,2,3].map(|$v, $i| "At index " + <string>$i + " we got a " + <string>$v + "!");
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	'At index 0 we got a 1!',
	'At index 1 we got a 2!',
	'At index 2 we got a 3!'
]
```

Chaining these methods one after another is a convenient way to validate and modify data in a single statement. The example below removes any items with a `NONE`, checks to see if a the location data is a valid geometric point, and then returns the remaining items as objects with a different structure.

```surql
[
	NONE,
	{
		at: (98, 65.7),
		name: "Some city"
	},
	{
		at: (-190.7, 0),
		name: NONE
	},
    {
        name: "Other city",
        at: (0.0, 0.1)
    },
	{
        name: "Nonexistent city",
        at: (200.0, 66.5)
    }
]
    .filter(|$v| $v != NONE AND $v.name != NONE)
    .filter(|$v| $v.at.is_valid())
    .map(|$v, $i| {
        item: $i,
        name: $v.name,
        coordinates: $v.at
    });
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		coordinates: (98, 65.7),
		item: 0,
		name: 'Some city'
	},
	{
		coordinates: (0, 0.1),
		item: 1,
		name: 'Other city'
	}
]
```

## Adding arrays

<Since v="v3.0.0-alpha.3" />

An array can be added to another array, resulting in a single array consisting of the items of the first followed by those of the second. This is identical to the `array::concat()` function.

```surql
[1,2] + [3,4]
[1,2].concat([3,4]);
```

```surql title="Output"
[1,2,3,4]
```
