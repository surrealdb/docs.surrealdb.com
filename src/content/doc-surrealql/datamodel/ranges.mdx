# Ranges

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

A range is composed of `..` and possible delimiters to set the maximum and minimum possible values. The default syntax includes the lower limit and excludes the upper limit. A `=` can be used to make the upper limit inclusive, and `>` can be used to make the lower limit exclusive.

```surql
-- From 0 up to 9
0..10;
-- From 0 up to 10
0..=10;
-- From 1 to 9
0>..10;
-- From 1 to 10
0>..=10;
```

A range becomes open ended if a delimiter is not specified.

```surql
-- Anything from 0 and up
0..;
-- Anything from 1 and up
0>..;
-- Anything up to 99
..100;
-- Anything up to 100
..=100;
-- An infinite range
..;
```

A range can be constructed from any type of value. This is most useful when comparing one value to another.

```surql
-- All true
'g' IN 'a'..'z';
d"2024-01-01" IN d"2020-01-01"..=d"2025-01-01";
['London', d"2022-02-02", 5.7] IN ['London', d"2020-01-01"]..=['London', d"2024-12-31"];

-- All false
"ㅋㅋㅋ" IN "a".."z";
d"2028-01-01" IN d"2020-01-01"..=d"2025-01-01";
['Philadelphia', d"2022-02-02", 5.7] IN ['London', d"2020-01-01"]..=['London', d"2024-12-31"];
```

## Ranges in FOR loops

Ranges of integers have the added convenience of being able to be used in a [FOR loop](/docs/surrealql/statements/for).

```surql
FOR $year IN 0..=2024 {
    CREATE historical_events SET
        for_year = $year,
        events = "To be added";
}
```

## Ranges in WHERE clauses

A range can be used in a `WHERE` clause in place of operators like `<` and `>`. This is especially useful when checking for a number that must be within a certain range. Using a range carries two main benefits. One is that it produces shorter code that is easier to read and maintain.

```surql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 65;
SELECT * FROM person WHERE age IN 18..=65;
```

Another benefit is performance. The following code should show a modest but measurable improvement in performance between the first and second `SELECT` statement, as only one condition needs to be checked instead of two.

```surql
DELETE person;
CREATE |person:20000| SET age = (rand::float() * 120).round() RETURN NONE;

-- Assign output to a parameter so the SELECT output is not displayed
LET $_ = SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 18 AND age < 65;
LET $_ = SELECT * FROM person WHERE age in 18..=65;
```

## Casting and functional usage

A range can be cast into an array.

```surql
<array> 1..3;
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	1,
	2
]
```

This opens up a range of functional programming patterns that are made possible by SurrealDB's [array functions](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/array), many of which can use [anonymous functions](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/closures) (closures) to perform an operation on each item in the array.

```surql
-- Construct an array
(<array> 1..=100)
-- Turn it into an array that increments by 10
    .map(|$v| $v * 10)
-- Turn each number into a object with original and square root value
    .map(|$v| { original: $v, square_root: math::sqrt($v) })
-- Keep only those with square roots in between 11 and 12
    .filter(|$obj| $obj.square_root IN 11..12);
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		original: 130,
		square_root: 11.40175425099138f
	},
	{
		original: 140,
		square_root: 11.832159566199232f
	}
]
```
