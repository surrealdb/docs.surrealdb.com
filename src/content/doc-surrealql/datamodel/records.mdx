# Record links

One of the most powerful features of SurrealDB is the ability to traverse from record-to-record without the need for traditional SQL JOINs. Each record ID points directly to a specific record in the database, without needing to run a table scan query. Record IDs can be stored within other records, allowing them to be linked together.

## Creating a record
When you create a record without specifying the id, then a randomly generated id is created and used for the record id.

```surql
CREATE person SET name = 'Tobie';

person:aio58g22n3upq16hsani
```

It's also possible to specify a specific record id when creating or updating records.

```surql
CREATE person:tester SET name = 'Tobie';

person:tester
```

## Select directly off of Record IDs
Because Record IDs are their own datatype in SurrealQL, you are able to select directly off of them.

```surql
CREATE person SET name = 'Tobie', email = 'tobie@surrealdb.com', opts.enabled = true;

-- Select the whole record
person:aio58g22n3upq16hsani.*

-- Select specific fields (since 2.0.0)
person:aio58g22n3upq16hsani.{ name, email }
```

## Storing record links within records

Records ids can be stored directly within other records, either as top-level properties, or nested within objects or arrays.

```surql
CREATE person:jaime SET name = 'Jaime', friends = [person:tobie, person:simon];
CREATE person:tobie SET name = 'Tobie', friends = [person:simon, person:marcus];
CREATE person:simon SET name = 'Simon', friends = [person:jaime, person:tobie];
CREATE person:marcus SET name = 'Marcus', friends = [person:tobie];
```

## Fetching remote records from within records

Nested field traversal can be used to fetch the properties from the remote records, as if the record was embedded within the record being queried.

```surql
SELECT friends.name FROM person:tobie;
[
	{
		friends: {
			name: ["Simon", "Marcus"]
		}
	}
]
```

There is no limit to the number of remote traversals that can be performed in a query. Using `.` dot notation, SurrealDB does not differentiate between nested object properties, or remote records, and will fetch remote records asynchronously when needed for a query.

```surql
SELECT friends.friends.friends.name FROM person:tobie;
[
	{
		friends: {
			friends: {
				friends: {
					name: [
						[ ["Tobie", "Simon"], ["Simon", "Marcus"] ],
						[ ["Simon", "Marcus"] ]
					]
				}
			}
		}
	}
]
```

## Drawbacks of embedding record links

In SurrealDB, embedding record links within records is a powerful feature allowing efficient querying and data retrieval. However, it also has a drawback: When an embedded record is deleted or changed, the parent record will not automatically reflect that change. This leads to stale references or “NONE” entries that can accumulate over time.

For referential integrity between records, we recommend using the [`RELATE`](/docs/surrealql/statements/relate) statement to create relationships that automatically update when the referenced record is deleted or changed.

## Next steps

You've now seen how to create records using randomly generated ids, or specific record ids. This is just the beginning! The power and flexibility which is possible with the remote record fetching functionality within queries opens up a whole new set of possibilities for storing and querying traditional data, and connected datasets. The next page follows up with a feature available in SurrealDB since version 2.2.0: the ability to use record links in a bidirectional manner thanks to reference tracking.
