title: Health Method in PHP | PHP SDK | Integration | SurrealDB
description: Check the storage layer health of a local or remote database using the health method with the SurrealDB PHP SDK.
---

import Label from "@components/shared/Label.astro";

# `->health()` {#health}

This method checks wether the database is running and the storage engine is running.

> [!NOTE]
> This method is only available on a remote database targeted with the http protocol.

```php title="Method Syntax"
$db->health();
```

### Example usage
```php
$health = $db->health();
echo "The health status is: $health."; // 200 or 500
```

The health function returns `200` if the database is running and is in good shape. `500` if a failure occurred.
