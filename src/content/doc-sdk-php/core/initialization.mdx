# Initialization

This is a guide on how to initialize the SurrealDB SDK for PHP. If you haven't installed the SDK yet in your PHP project, You can go to [getting started](/docs/sdk/php/setup) to learn how to install the SDK.

<Tabs groupId="php-include-or-use">
	<TabItem value="composer" label="Composer" default>
		Before we can make use of any of the packages we have installed for our project, we need to include the `autoload.php` file in our project.
		This file is generated by Composer and it contains all the classes and dependencies that we have installed in our project.
		```php
		include_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When we have imported the `Surreal` class, we can initialize a new instance of SurrealDB.
After this is done we can make use of certain methods to interact with the database.

```php
$db = new Surreal();
```

Then we connect to the database. The `connect` method takes the URL of
the database as an argument. The URL can be either `http` or `ws` protocol.

<Tabs groupId="php-protocol">
  <TabItem value="http" label="HTTP" default>
		```php
		$db->connect("http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc");
		```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="ws" label="WebSocket">
		```php
		$db->connect("ws://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc");
		```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In order to send queries to the database,
we need to set the `namespace` and `database` for the current connection you want
to interact with.

```php
$db->use([
	"namespace" => "test",
	"database" => "test"
]);
```

We should now be successfully connected to the database. In the next article we will cover authenticating our connection.
