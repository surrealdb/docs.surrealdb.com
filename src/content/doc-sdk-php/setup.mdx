# Getting Started

Before you can use this SDK in PHP, you need to install the SDK via the [Composer package](https://getcomposer.org/download/) manager.
This guide will walk you through the process of installing the SDK into your project.

### Install the SDK

Within your Compose project, run the following command to install the SDK:

```bash
composer require surrealdb/surrealdb.php
```

### Using the SDK

Once you have installed the SDK, make sure to include the [Composer autoloader](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) in your PHP script:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

You can now use the SDK in your PHP script by importing it:

```php
use Surreal\Surreal;
```

Now that you have the SDK installed and imported, you can start using the SDK to interact with SurrealDB.

Check out the [initialization guide](/docs/sdk/php/core/initialization) to learn more.
