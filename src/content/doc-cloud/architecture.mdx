# Cloud architecture

SurrealDB Cloud benefits from [SurrealDBâ€™s layered architecture](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture), which separates storage from compute, enabling improved scalability, durability and availability without the need to operate, manage, scale or shard your database.

## Start
For development, and staging applications with vertically-scalable requirements. SurrealDB Cloud Start provides users with dedicated storage and a single-node for compute which can scale vertically.

## Dedicated

For large-scale, mission-critical applications. Dedicated environment horizontal and vertical scalability, providing fault-tolerant and highly scalable deployments, without the need to shard your database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the future, we plan to offer an option to launch multiple instances against a centralised storage layer together with autoscaling. These features will allow customers to, for example, have one production instance autoscaling running 24x7 for the main transactional part of the application and have different data & analytics teams querying the same centralised storage layer with their own individual compute needs (e.g. higher memory or GPU) meaning they can run only when needed for the specific query.

To learn more about the plans, please refer to the [Pricing](/pricing) page.
