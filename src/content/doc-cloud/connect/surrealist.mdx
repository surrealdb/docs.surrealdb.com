# Connect via Surrealist

Once you have created a Surreal Cloud instance, you can connect to it in Surrealist, which allows you to interact with your created Cloud instance from the [query view in Surrealist](/docs/surrealist/concepts/sending-queries).

Start by clicking the **Connect** button on your instance. Then select the **Open in Surrealist** option in the connection modal. This will open the Surrealist query view.

	}}
/>

## Querying your Instance 

Once in the query view, and before you can run queries in Surrealist, you need to select a [Namespace](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts) and a [Database](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts) to work in.

First click on the **Namespace** dropdown and select the namespace you want to work in (if you have not created a namespace, you will see an option to create one). Then click on the **Database** dropdown and select the database you want to work in.

<Image
alt="Namespace and Database"
src={{
	light: NamespaceDatabaseLight,
	dark: NamespaceDatabaseDark,
	}}
/>

Once you have selected a namespace and database, you can start running queries in Surrealist. You can run queries to create, read, update, and delete data in your Surreal Cloud instance.

<Image

src={{
	light: QueryingInstanceLight,
	dark: QueryingInstanceDark,
	}}
/>

You can now see your queries and results in the Surrealist query view. You can also see the created records in the explore view.
