# Querying in Surrealist

Once you have created a Surreal Cloud Instance, you can start querying it in Surrealist in the [query view](/docs/surrealist/concepts/sending-queries).

In the query view, and before you can run queries in Surrealist, you need to select a [Namespace](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts) and a [Database](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts) to work in.

First click on the **Namespace** button and select the namespace you want to work in (if you have not created a namespace, you will see an option to create one). Then click on the **Database** button and select the database you want to work in (if you have not created a namespace, you will see an option to create one).

<Image
alt="Namespace and Database"
src={{
	light: NamespaceDatabaseLight,
	dark: NamespaceDatabaseDark,
	}}
/>

Once you have selected a namespace and database, you can start running queries in Surrealist. You can run queries to create, read, update, and delete data in your Surreal Cloud Instance.

<Image
alt="Querying Instance"
src={{
	light: QueryingInstanceLight,
	dark: QueryingInstanceDark,
	}}
/>

You can now see your queries and results in the Surrealist query view. You can also see the created records in the explore view.
