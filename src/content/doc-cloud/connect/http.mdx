# Connect via HTTP using cURL

Surreal Cloud supports connection via HTTP. This allows you to connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance using curl or any HTTP client. To get started, select the **Connect** button on your Instance. Then select **HTTP cURL**. 

This will open a modal to fill in your credentials for **Namespace** and **Database** and authentication before you can copy the URL.

> [!NOTE]
> The URL provided can be used in any HTTP client, but by default it is set to use curl. Use the URL in your HTTP client to connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance from clients like Postman or any other HTTP client.

## Connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance

Once you have filled in the credentials, copy the URL and connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance. Below is an example of the connection URL in curl.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://cloud-demo-069qmb9jjttknc0djomp73flfs.aws-use1.surreal.cloud/version"
