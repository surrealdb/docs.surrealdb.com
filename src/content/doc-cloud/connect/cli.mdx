# Connect via CLI

Once you have created a Surreal Cloud Instance, you can connect to it via CLI. The SurrealDB CLI lets you interact with your Surreal Cloud Instance from the command line.


## Prerequisites

Before connecting to your Surreal Cloud Instance using the CLI, you need to install the [SurrealDB CLI](/docs/surrealdb/installation).

## Connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance

Once it is installed, you can connect to your Surreal Cloud Instance using the [`surreal sql`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) command. This command connects to your Surreal Cloud Instance using the specified endpoint and token. 

```bash
surreal sql --endpoint <endpoint> --token <token>
```

<Image
alt="Surreal Cloud"
src={{
	light: OpenInCLI,
	dark: OpenInCLI,
	}}
/>

The `token` is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is used to authenticate your connection to the Surreal Cloud Instance. You can find the token in the Instance details page in the Surreal Cloud console.
