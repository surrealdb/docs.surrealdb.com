# Billing

Surreal Cloud offers a flexible pricing model that allows you to pay only for the resources you use. The pricing is based on the amount of storage, compute power, and network bandwidth you consume, enabling you to scale your resources up or down based on your requirements.

You can manage your billing information and payment details in the Billing section of the Surreal Cloud dashboard.


## Update billing information

To update your billing information, you can click on the **Update** button on the top right corner of the billing information page.

## View payment details

To view your payment details, you can click on the **Billing** tab in the Surreal Cloud dashboard. This will display a comprehensive overview of your payment history, including past invoices, current charges, and upcoming payments. 

You can also see information about your payment method, billing cycle, and any active subscriptions or usage-based charges.


## Discount codes

If you have a discount code, you can enter it in the **Discount code** field on the billing page. This will apply the discount to your account and reduce the amount you owe.


## Referrals

The Surreal Cloud referral program allows you to invite a friend in exchange for benefits.

1. Refer a friend by sharing your personalized referral link. You can find your personalized referral link [in the Billing dashboard](https://app.surrealdb.com/cloud/billing).
2. After your friend signs up, you will receive $10 of credit (up to a max of $50 or 5 referrals) and your friend will receive $25. In order to use your rewards you must enter your billing details.

## Invoices

You can view and download your payment invoices in the Surreal Cloud dashboard.
