# Billing

SurrealDB Cloud offers a flexible pricing model that allows you to pay only for the resources you use. Charges are based on the amount of storage, compute power, and network bandwidth you use, enabling you to scale your resources up or down based on your requirements.

Billing in SurrealDB Cloud is managed at the **Organisation level**, not the instance level.  Therefore, deleting an instance does not remove historical invoices.

Within an organisation, billing is divided into two sections: **Billing** and **Invoices**.

## Billing tab

The **Billing** tab allows you to manage your organisation’s payment and billing information.

It includes:

- **Billing details** (name and email associated with the account)
- **Payment details** (payment method and card information)
- **Discount Codes**

### Update billing or payment details

To update your billing or payment information:

1. Log in to SurrealDB Cloud  
2. Navigate to **Organisations**  
3. Select the relevant organisation  
4. Open the **Billing** tab  
5. Click **Edit** on either Billing details or Payment details  

### Apply a discount code

You can apply a discount code in the **Discount Codes** section of the Billing tab.

## Invoices tab

The **Invoices** tab allows you to view and download invoices for service charges associated with your organisation.

To access invoices:

1. Log in to SurrealDB Cloud  
2. Navigate to **Organisations**  
3. Select the relevant organisation  
4. Open the **Invoices** tab 

All invoices remain available even if individual instances have been deleted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only **Organisation Owners and Admins** can view invoices.

## AWS Marketplace customers

If you subscribed to SurrealDB Cloud through **AWS Marketplace**, billing is managed entirely within your AWS account.

Invoices and payment information are available in the **AWS Billing & Cost Management** console.

Invoices will not appear in the SurrealDB Cloud Invoices tab for AWS Marketplace subscriptions.
