# Billing

SurrealDB Cloud offers a flexible pricing model that allows you to pay only for the resources you use. The pricing is based on the amount of storage, compute power, and network bandwidth you consume, enabling you to scale your resources up or down based on your requirements.

You can manage your billing information and payment details in the Billing section of the SurrealDB Cloud dashboard.


## Update billing information

To update your billing information, you can click on the **Update** button on the top right corner of the billing information page.
