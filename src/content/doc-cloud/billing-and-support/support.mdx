# Support

SurrealDB Cloud offers a range of support options to help you get started, enhance your skills, and resolve any issues you may encounter. You can use the free community support via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/surrealdb) server or signup for a **paid support plan**. 

To learn more about the support plans, please see the [pricing page](/pricing).

## Paid support plan

### Add a support plan to your Organisation

In order to be able to create a support ticket, you need to add a support plan to your organisation. You can add a support plan by clicking the **Support** tab in the Surrealist sidebar. If you do not have a support plan, you will see the **View plans** option. 

This will take you to the pricing page where you can choose the plan you want to use for your organisation.

>[!NOTE] 
>If you already have a support plan this tab will display your support plan and any open tickets you have.

### Creating a support ticket
