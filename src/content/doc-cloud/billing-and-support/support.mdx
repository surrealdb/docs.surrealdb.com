# Support

Surreal Cloud offers a variety of tools, resources, and community channels to help you get started, enhance your skills, and resolve any issues you may encounter depending on your problem.

## Surreal Sidekick (beta)

Surreal Sidekick (beta) is an AI copilot that can help you get started with SurrealDB, convert queries to SurrealQL, and answer general questions. Surreal Sidekick is only trained with public facing resources, such as our [SurrealDB documentation](/docs/surrealdb), [SurrealDB University](/learn), and the [SurrealDB Book](/learn/book).
