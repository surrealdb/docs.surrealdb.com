description: Surrealist is a user interface for interacting with your SurrealDB database visually. It enables you to seamlessly connect to any SurrealDB instance, allowing you to execute queries, explore your tables, design your schemas, and much more.
---


#  Settings and customisation

In the bottom left of the interface you can find a settings(⚙) button to open the Settings dialog. These Settings allow you to further customise the behaviour and appearance of Surrealist, such as switching between light and dark mode, increasing or decreasing the editor font sizes, and configure default values for new connections.

## Behaviour

In this section you can configure the behaviour of the interface, such as **connection** and **editor** related settings.

## Appearance

The appearance section allows you to scale the fonts in the editor and also select your default query output view and set the behaviour for your Query and designer views.

You can also show your created instances in a list or a grid. 

## Filters

You can filter the instances by their type (**nano**, **small**) and their region (**AWS US East (N. Virginia)** or **AWS EU West (Ireland)**).

## Templates

You can configure [connection templates](/docs/surrealist/advanced-topics/connection-templates) to reuse connection details when creating new connections. This is especially useful when you find yourself connecting to similar databases frequently.
