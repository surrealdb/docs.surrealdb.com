## Network access

Network access is a type of [Instance capability](/docs/cloud/advanced-topics/configure-an-instance#instance-capabilities) that allows you to control and manage how your Surreal Cloud Instance connects to external services and networks.

With this feature, you can define precise rules that determine which network destinations your database can access. This helps protect your data, prevent unauthorized connections, and ensure compliance with your organization’s security policies.

In Surreal Cloud, network access lets you:

- Allow or deny outbound connections to specific domains, IP addresses, or ranges.
- Create custom policies that fit your infrastructure and security needs.

By leveraging network access, you gain full control over your database’s connectivity, reducing the risk of accidental data leaks or malicious activity.

> [!NOTE]
> Supported versions: `>=2.1.8, <2.2.0` or `>=2.2.6, <2.3.0` or `>=2.3.6`. If you are using a different version, you can still use network access, but you will need to manually upgrade to access the network access rules.


## Using network access in Surreal Cloud 

In your Surreal Cloud dashboard, you can easily configure and preview network access rules.

### Configure network access in Surreal Cloud

1.	Open the Network Access Section:In the Surreal Cloud dashboard, click on the **configure instance** button to open the instance configuration drawer. Here, you’ll find the **network access** option (set to Deny by default) to specify allowed and denied network patterns.

2.	Set Allowed and Denied Patterns:
    - Enter the domains, IP addresses, you wish to allow in the **Allowed by default** field.
    - Add any domains or IPs you want to block in the **Denied by default** field.
