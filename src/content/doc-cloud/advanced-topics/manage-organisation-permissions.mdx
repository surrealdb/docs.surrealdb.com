# Manage Organisation permissions

Surreal Cloud allows you to manage the permissions of your Organisation. This includes adding members to your Organisation, removing members, and changing their permissions (as an owner). In this section, we will go through the different roles and permissions that are available in Surreal Cloud.


## Role permissions

In an Organisation, by default the creator of the Organisation is the owner. The owner can invite new members to the Organisation and change their permissions. In inviting a new member they can be assigned a role of admin or member. Next lets go through the different permissions assigned to each role.
