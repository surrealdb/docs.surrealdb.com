# Manage Organisation permissions

Surreal Cloud allows you to manage the permissions of your Organisation. This includes adding members to your Organisation, removing members, and changing their permissions (as an owner). In this section, we will go through the different roles and permissions that are available in Surreal Cloud.


## Role permissions

In an Organisation, by default the creator of the Organisation is the owner. The owner can invite new members to the Organisation and change their permissions. In inviting a new member they can be assigned a role of admin or member. Next lets go through the different permissions assigned to each role.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Permissions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Owner</strong></td>
      <td>The owner of the Organisation</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Can manage the Organisation instances, team, usage and billing information</li>
          <li>Can access Instance capabilities</li>
          <li>Can invite and remove members from the Organisation</li>
          <li>Can change the permissions of other members</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Admin</strong></td>
      <td>An admin of the Organisation</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Can do everything an owner can do except for managing the [billing information](/docs/cloud/billing-and-support/billing) or update other users permissions</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Member</strong></td>
      <td>A member of the Organisation</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Can only view the existing Organisation instances, team. Within the team they can only remove themselves</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> In the future we will allow users to control permissions granularly for each user, create new roles and manage permissions for each role.
