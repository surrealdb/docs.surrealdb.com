# Backup and restore

This section covers the backup and restore options for your SurrealDB Cloud Instance and the process of selecting a backup strategy. It also covers your responsibilities for backing up data stored in your SurrealDB Cloud instance and the available options for data export and recovery.

## Backup

SurrealDB Cloud provides a robust backup and restore solution for your SurrealDB Cloud instance. You can backup your data to a local file or to an external storage location. You can also restore your data from a backup file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Automated backups are not available for free Instances. To enable automated backups, you must upgrade to a [paid plan](/pricing). This gives you access to restore your data from a backup file.

### Restoring from a backup 

In the resources section of the Instance dashboard, you can access the list of all your available backups. To restore from a backup, click the **Create from selected** button on the backup you want to restore from. 

<Image
alt="Restoring from a backup"
src={{ 
	light: BackupLight,
	dark: BackupDark,
	}}  
/>


This will will take you to the [create a new Instance ](/docs/cloud/getting-started/create-an-instance#create-from-selected) page with the backup option already selected.

src={{ 
	light: RestoreLight,
	dark: RestoreDark,
	}}  
/>

You can also view a list of all available backups from the backup select dropdown in the Instance creation page.

## Limitations of the backup and restore feature

- The source and restore instance must be in the same region
- It is not possible to restore a backup into an existing (or the same) Instance
- The storage of the restore Instance must be equal or greater than the source Instance
