# Connecting using AWS PrivateLink

[AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) lets you connect your AWS VPC to SurrealDB Cloud over a private network path that never traverses the public internet, improving both security and network isolation.

> [!NOTE]
> AWS PrivateLink is an enterprise feature. Onboarding is a manual process handled by the SurrealDB Cloud team, and requires coordinated setup on both sides. Contact [support](/contact) to get started.

## Prerequisites

- You have a SurrealDB Cloud instance.
- You have an AWS account.
- You have an AWS VPC.
- You have AWS IAM credentials (user, role, or policy) with the necessary permissions to create interface VPC endpoints.
## How it works

Once onboarded, you create an [interface VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html) in your AWS account that connects directly to SurrealDB Cloud. The endpoint is assigned a private IP address within your VPC, so all traffic between your application and SurrealDB Cloud stays on the AWS private network — it never touches the public internet and is not routed through a NAT gateway or internet gateway.

Public and PrivateLink instances use entirely separate connection paths and DNS namespaces, so the access mode is always explicit and enforceable:

- **Public instances** resolve under `*.aws-usw2.surreal.cloud` and are reachable from the internet.
- **PrivateLink instances** resolve under `*.privatelink.aws-usw2.surreal.cloud` and are only resolvable from within your VPC.

The two paths are fully isolated at the network level — there is no shared infrastructure between them. This makes accidental public exposure of a private instance impossible by design.

## Onboarding process

Enabling AWS PrivateLink for your organisation involves both your team and the SurrealDB Cloud team. It cannot be self-served through the SurrealDB Cloud dashboard.

The steps are:

1. **Contact SurrealDB support** to request PrivateLink access for your organisation and region.
2. **SurrealDB sets up the private connection** on our side and shares the details you need to complete your end.
3. **You configure a private endpoint** in your AWS account using those details.
4. **SurrealDB completes the setup** and enables PrivateLink for your organisation and region.

Once onboarding is complete, you can view and manage the access mode of your instances from the SurrealDB Cloud dashboard.

## Instance access modes

Each instance in a PrivateLink-enabled region can be set to one of three access modes:

<Table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Access mode</th>
            <th scope="col">Description</th>
            <th scope="col">Hostname</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Access mode">
                <code>public</code>
            </td>
            <td data-label="Description">
                Accessible via the public internet only. Default for all instances.
            </td>
            <td data-label="Hostname">
                <code>*.aws-usw2.surreal.cloud</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Access mode">
                <code>private</code>
            </td>
            <td data-label="Description">
                Accessible via PrivateLink only. No public hostname is assigned.
            </td>
            <td data-label="Hostname">
                <code>*.privatelink.aws-usw2.surreal.cloud</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td scope="row" data-label="Access mode">
                <code>dual</code>
            </td>
            <td data-label="Description">
                Accessible via both public internet and PrivateLink.
            </td>
            <td data-label="Hostname">
                Both
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</Table>

All existing instances default to `public`. The `private` and `dual` modes are only available after your organisation has been onboarded.

## Limitations

- AWS PrivateLink is currently available in **US West 2 (Oregon)** only. Additional regions will be added over time.
- PrivateLink must be enabled for your organisation by the SurrealDB Cloud team before it can be used.
- PrivateLink hostnames are only resolvable from within your VPC. They cannot be used to connect from outside AWS.
