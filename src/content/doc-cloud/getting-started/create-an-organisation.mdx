# Create an Organisation

SurrealDB Cloud allows you to create a new Organisation with a few clicks to seperately manage your different projects. 

You can create an Organisation in these steps from the overview:

1. On the overview page, click on the **Create organisation** button. This will take you to the create Organisation form.

2. Enter the name of the Organisation and click on the **Create organisation** button.

You will be redirected to the Organisation overview page where you can manage your Organisation instances, team, usage and billing information.


## Organisation Overview

After you create a new Organisation, you will be automatically added as [the owner of the Organisation](/docs/cloud/advanced-topics/manage-organisation-permissions). As an Organisation owner, you can manage your Organisation instances, team, usage and billing information from the overview page. 

To create a new Instance, click on the **Deploy Instance** button and follow the steps in the [create an instance](/docs/cloud/getting-started/create-an-instance) documentation.

When you visit the Organisation overview page, you'll find everything you need to manage your Organisation in one place:

- The **Instances** tab shows all your database instances. Here you can create new instances, monitor how they're running, and make any needed changes.

- Under **Team**, you can handle everything related to your Organisation's members - invite new people, remove members who have left, and set what each person is allowed to do.

- The **Usage** tab helps you keep an eye on how much of your resources you're using, with easy-to-read metrics and trends.

- In **Billing**, you can manage all your payment details - update payment methods, view past invoices, and handle any billing-related tasks.


Depending on your permissions, the overview page will show different sections. More information about the different roles and permissions can be found in the [manage Organisation permissions](/docs/cloud/advanced-topics/manage-organisation-permissions) section.

## Invite members to your Organisation

To invite members to your Organisation, click on the **Team** tab and then the **Invite member** button. This will open a modal where you can invite a new member to your Organisation and the role of the member. Learn more about what each role does in the [manage Organisation permissions](/docs/cloud/advanced-topics/manage-organisation-permissions) section.

## Manage Organisation permissions

SurrealDB Cloud allows you to manage the permissions of your Organisation. This includes adding members to your Organisation, removing members, and changing their permissions (as an owner). In this section, we will go through the different roles and permissions that are available in SurrealDB Cloud .


## Role permissions

In an Organisation, by default the creator of the Organisation is the owner. The owner can invite new members to the Organisation and change their permissions. In inviting a new member they can be assigned a role of admin or member. The following chart shows the different permissions assigned to each role.



<table style={{ width: '100%' }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Permissions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>Owner</strong></td>
      <td>The owner of the Organisation</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Can manage the Organisation instances, team, usage and billing information</li>
          <li>Can access Instance capabilities</li>
          <li>Can invite and remove members from the Organisation</li>
          <li>Can change the permissions of other members</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>Admin</strong></td>
      <td>An admin of the Organisation</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Can do everything an owner can do except for managing the [billing information](/docs/cloud/billing-and-support/billing) or update other users permissions</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>Member</strong></td>
      <td>A member of the Organisation</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Can only view the existing Organisation instances, team. Within the team they can only remove themselves</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> In the future we will allow users to control permissions granularly for each user, create new roles and manage permissions for each role.
