# Create an Organisation

Surreal Cloud allows you to create a new Organisation with a few clicks by default your personal account is an Individual organisation however, if you want to seperately manage your organisation and personal account, you can create a new Organisation. 

You can create an Organisation in these steps from the overview:

1. Click on the **Create new** button and select the **Organisation** option. This will take you to the create organisation form.

2. Enter the name of the Organisation and click on the **Create Organisation** button.

You will be redirected to the Organisation overview page where you can manage your Organisation instances, team, usage and billing information.


## Organisation Overview

After you create a new organisation, you will be automatically added as the owner of the organisation. As an Organisation owner, you can manage your organisation instances, team, usage and billing information from the overview page. 

To create a new Instance, click on the **New Instance** button and follow the steps in the [create an instance](/docs/cloud/getting-started/create-an-instance) documentation.

When you visit the Organisation overview page, you'll find everything you need to manage your organisation in one place:

- The **Instances** tab shows all your database instances. Here you can create new instances, monitor how they're running, and make any needed changes.

- Under **Team**, you can handle everything related to your organisation's members - invite new people, remove members who've left, and set what each person is allowed to do.

- The **Usage** tab helps you keep an eye on how much of your resources you're using, with easy-to-read metrics and trends.

- In **Billing**, you can manage all your payment details - update payment methods, view past invoices, and handle any billing-related tasks.


Depending on your permissions, the overview page will show different sections. More information about the different roles and permissions can be found in the [manage organisation permissions](/docs/cloud/advanced-topics/manage-organisation-permissions) section.

## Invite members to your organisation

To invite members to your organisation, click on the **Team** tab and then click on the **Invite member** button. This will open a modal where you can invite a new member to your organisation and the role of the member. Learn more about what each role does in the [manage organisation permissions](/docs/cloud/advanced-topics/manage-organisation-permissions) section.
