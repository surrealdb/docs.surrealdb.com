# Create an Instance

SurrealDB Cloud allows you to create a new Instance with a few clicks. You can create an Instance in your personal account or in an organization. 

You can create an Instance in these steps from the overview:

1. Click on the **Deploy Instance** button. This will take you to the plan page where you can choose the plan you want to use for your Instance.

2. After you have selected your plan, configure your Instance. You can choose between the following Instance types:

    - **General purpose**: for production environments, data at scale, or professional use cases.

    - **Burstable**: for testing, starter projects, or for low-traffic applications. Clusters under heavy load may experience CPU throttling.

    - **Free Tier**: experience SurrealDB with a free Instance.

3. Input your Instance details.
    - **Region**: the region you want to deploy your Instance in. 
        - AWS US East (N. Virginia)
        - AWS US West (Oregon)
        - AWS Europe (Ireland)
    - **SurrealDB version**: the version of SurrealDB you want to use. Selecting the latest version is recommended but if you select a lower version, you will be able to upgrade to the latest in your Instance settings.
    - **Instance name**: the name of the Instance.

4. You have the option to select Instance Data from the following options:
    - **Empty**: this will create a new SurrealDB Instance with no data.
    - **Demo dataset**: this option will populate your Instance with a demo dataset and some sample queries to get you started.
    - **Upload from file**: this will allow you to upload a CSV file to your Instance.
    - **Restore from backup**: this will allow you to restore a backup of an existing Instance.

# Configure an Instance

After you have created an Instance, you can configure it to your needs. This includes changing the Instance type, compute nodes, and capabilities. To do this, click on the **Configure Instance** button on the Instance card; this will open up a configuration drawer.

## Instance Configuration

In the Instance configuration drawer, you can change the following settings:

- **Capabilities**: the capabilities of the Instance, this controls the functionality available to users such as scripting, guest access, enabled endpoints for RPC and HTTP endpoints. You can also opt into beta features and restrict access to specific resources.
- **Version**: the version of SurrealDB that will be used for the Instance. If you a new version is available, you will be prompted to upgrade and also see the release notes.


### Instance capabilities

The capabilities you choose will determine the features available to your Instance. This includes scripting, guest access, enabled endpoints for RPC and HTTP and more. For RPC methods, HTTP endpoints and preview features, you can leave pick one of the following options:

- **Allow all by default**: All endpoints are allowed by default and you can then select which endpoints to deny.
- **Deny all by default**: All endpoints are denied by default and you can then select which endpoints to allow.

On the other hand network access and functions provide a more granular control over the endpoints.
