# Create an Instance

Surreal Cloud allows you to create a new Instance with a few clicks. You can create an Instance in your personal account or in an organization. 

You can create an Instance in these steps from the overview:

1. Click on the **Deploy Instance** button. This will take you to the plan page where you can choose the plan you want to use for your Instance.

2. After you have selected your plan, configure your Instance. You can choose between the following Instance types:

    - **General purpose**: for production environments, data at scale, or professional use cases.

    - **Burstable**: for testing, starter projects, or for low-traffic applications. Clusters under heavy load may experience CPU throttling.

    - **Free Tier**: experience SurrealDB with a free Instance.

3. Input your Instance details.
    - **Region**: the region you want to deploy your Instance in. 
        - AWS US East (N. Virginia)
        - AWS Europe (Ireland)
    - **SurrealDB version**: the version of SurrealDB you want to use. Selecting the latest version is recommended but if you select a lower version, you will be able to upgrade to the latest in your Instance settings.
    - **Instance name**: the name of the Instance.

4. You have the option to select Instance Data from the following options:
    - **Empty**: this will create a new SurrealDB Instance with no data.
    - **Demo dataset**: this option will populate your Instance with a demo dataset and some sample queries to get you started.
    - **Upload from file**: this will allow you to upload a CSV file to your Instance.
    - **Restore from backup**: this will allow you to restore a backup of an existing Instance.

5. In the **Storage** section, select storage capacity. This is the amount of storage you want to allocate to your Instance. Depending on the plan you have selected, you will have different options.
