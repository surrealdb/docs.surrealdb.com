# Create a SurrealDB Cloud account

To get started, in the Surrealist app, click on the **Explore SurrealDB Cloud** option on the start screen. This will open the Cloud dashboard on the sidebar. Click on the **continue** button to create a SurrealDB Cloud account. You will be redirected to the SurrealDB Cloud authentication page where you can create or sign in to your account.

This account is used to authenticate your access to SurrealDB Cloud and [manage your created Instances](/docs/cloud/getting-started/create-an-instance).



## Registration options

There are several ways to create a SurrealDB Cloud account. The options are Google, GitHub. Please use only one of the available options to avoid conflicts: 

- [Create an Account with Google](#create-an-account-with-google)
- [Create an Account with GitHub](#create-an-account-with-github)
- [Create an Account with Email](#create-an-account-with-email)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you sign in with Google or GitHub, you will be briefly redirected to their secure sign-in page through SurrealDB Cloud . This process uses OAuth2, a secure authentication protocol that allows you to use your existing account without sharing your password with us. We only request basic information (email address and name) from your account. After you authorize the connection, the provider sends a secure token back to SurrealDB Cloud , confirming your identity and granting you access to our services.

### Create an Account with Google

Using your Google account to sign up offers a quick and convenient way to create a SurrealDB Cloud account. It leverages Google's secure authentication system and eliminates the need for a separate password. 


To create an account with Google, follow these steps:

1. Select **Sign up with Google** option that says "Sign Up with Google" or displays the Google logo in the authentication page
2. Choose Google Account: a Google sign-in window will appear; select the Google account you wish to use or enter your Google email and password
3. Grant permissions: review the permissions requested by the platform and click "Allow" to grant access
4. **Account created and logged in**: your new account is now created using your Google credentials, and you are automatically logged in

### Create an Account with GitHub

Creating an account with your GitHub account is a quick and convenient way to create a SurrealDB Cloud account. It leverages GitHub's secure authentication system and eliminates the need for a separate password. 

To create an account with GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Select **Sign up with GitHub** option that says "Sign Up with GitHub" or displays the GitHub logo in the authentication page
2. Choose GitHub Account: a GitHub sign-in window will appear; select the GitHub account you wish to use or enter your GitHub email and password if prompted
3. Grant permissions: review the permissions requested by the platform and click "Allow" to grant access
4. **Account created and logged in**: your new account is now created using your GitHub credentials, and you are automatically logged in

### Create an Account with Email

Creating an account using your email address allows you to register without linking a third-party service. This option is ideal if you prefer to use a custom password or don't want to connect your Google or GitHub accounts.

To create an account with Email, follow these steps:

1. Select **Sign up with Email** on the authentication page.
2. Enter your email address 
3. You'll have the option to create a secure password or use a passkey.
4. Confirm your email address by clicking the verification link sent to your inbox.
5. Your new account is now created, and you can log in with your email and password.

> [!NOTE]
> If you forget your password, you can reset it by clicking on the **Forgot password?** link on the authentication page and follow the instructions sent to your email.
