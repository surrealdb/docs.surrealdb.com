## Security

### How secure is Surreal Cloud (Beta)?

Surreal Cloud (Beta) is designed with security in mind and aims to provide robust protection for your data and applications. The platform leverages industry-standard security practices, including encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation, access controls and monitoring. For authentication, Surreal Cloud (Beta) supports multi-factor authentication through the available identity providers that offer it to their users. We are also working towards ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliance, with plans to expand to other industry-specific compliance programs in the future, such as HIPAA or PCI DSS.

Additionally, Surreal Cloud (Beta) is built on top of SurrealDB, which provides powerful and flexible [security features](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/summary#product) that are available to all Surreal Cloud (Beta) customers. SurrealDB is developed and maintained following modern [security practices](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/security/summary#process) to ensure early detection of security vulnerabilities and other security issues.

Please note that we will keep improving security during the ongoing beta stage and, as a precaution, we recommend abstaining from hosting sensitive data in Surreal Cloud (Beta) during this stage.

### How can I report a security issue in Surreal Cloud (Beta)?

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Surreal Cloud (Beta) or SurrealDB, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly address the issue. Please report any security issue to [security@surrealdb.com](mailto:security@surrealdb.com). For security issues in SurrealDB, please submit a report via [Github Security Advisories](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories) rather than posting a public issue in GitHub.

We ask that you...

- ... privately disclose the details of any potential vulnerability to SurrealDB.
- ... provide enough information to reproduce the vulnerability in your report.

We ask that you refrain from...

- ... disclosing the details of a vulnerability publicly or to third parties.
- ... exploiting a vulnerability beyond what is strictly necessary to verify its existence.
- ... running automated security tools against SurrealDB infrastructure without permission.

We commit to...

- ... acknowledging your report within three business days of the date of communication.
- ... verifying the issue and keeping you informed of the progress toward its resolution.
- ... handling your report and any data you share with us with strict confidentiality.
- ... abstaining from legal action against you for any report made following this policy.
- ... crediting you in any relevant public security advisory unless you desire otherwise.

### How do I configure user authentication?
Surreal Cloud allows users to authenticate directly into their instances from Surrealist using a pre-defined access method. Once connected to your Instance, you may [define users](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) or [access methods](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access) that users can use to access your Instance or specific namespaces or databases using any of the available [interfaces](/docs/surrealdb/integration), the [SurrealDB CLI](/docs/surrealdb/cli) or [Surrealist](https://surrealist.app/query).

### Can I use my own encryption keys?
Currently, any encryption keys used to encrypt data at rest are managed by Surreal Cloud. Since the architecture technically supports it, we may consider allowing customers to associate their own Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) to be used to encrypt data at rest in the future. If you are interested in CMEK, please, contact us.

### Can I limit who can reach my instances over the internet?
All instances created in Surreal Cloud are publicly reachable over the internet and currently rely exclusively on the authentication and authorization mechanisms that are defined within the instance to prevent access to their data. We plan on providing the ability to restrict network access to instances as well as the ability to limit the [capabilities](/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities) of each instance in the future. If your use case requires private network access to the instances, please, contact us.
