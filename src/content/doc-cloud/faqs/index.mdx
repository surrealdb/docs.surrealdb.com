# Frequently asked questions

If you have questions about Surreal Cloud, you can find answers on this page. This document provides a comprehensive understanding of Surreal Cloud, whether you are a beginner getting started with Surreal Cloud or an experienced user looking for specific information.

## General questions 

### What is Surreal Cloud? 

Surreal Cloud offers the power and flexibility of SurrealDB without the pain of managing infrastructure. We take care of managing and operating the underlying infrastructure so that you can focus on what you do best-building great applications for your customers. 


### How do I get started with Surreal Cloud?

Getting started is easy.  [Sign up for an account on Surrealist](https://surrealist.app/cloud/). Once registered, you can access the dashboard, choose services, and start building with Surreal Cloud immediately.

### Are there self-help resources like documentation or tutorials available?
Yes. We have a [resource hub with all our latest documentation](/docs/).  We also recommend our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjf2teVEuYVvvVC-gFZNq6w) where you can find easy-to-follow tutorials, and content from our Community.


### What kind of support is available at the launch of Surreal Cloud?

We are offering community support at launch.  You can get help via our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/surrealdb) `#surreal-cloud` or any of our [community channels](/community). 

### Which cloud platform is SurrealDB available on?

At present, SurrealDB is available on AWS. In the future we plan to expand to other cloud platforms.

### My current application is on SurrealDB.  Can I move this to Surreal Cloud?
Yes. You can move your current application built in SurrealDB to Surreal Cloud. You can find more information in the [migrate your existing data](/docs/cloud/advanced-topics/migrating-data) documentation.

### How do I migrate my existing on-premises instance to Surreal Cloud?

We are working on a migration tool to help you move your existing on-premises instance to Surreal Cloud.  In the meantime, you can use the `import` and `export` commands to move data between your on-premises instance and Surreal Cloud. 

### When will Surreal Cloud leave beta?

Surreal Cloud is currently in beta as we continue to improve the platform and add new features. 

### What programming languages are supported?

Surreal Cloud supports the following programming languages:

- [JavaScript/TypeScript](/docs/sdk/javascript)
- [Python](/docs/sdk/python)
- [Go](/docs/sdk/golang)
- [Java](/docs/sdk/java)
- [Rust](/docs/sdk/rust)
- [PHP](/docs/sdk/php)
- [.NET](/docs/sdk/dotnet)

### Why am I getting an authentication error connecting via SDK? 

You need to create a User first. Head to the [connect via SDK](/docs/cloud/connect/sdk) documentation for more details.

### Does Surreal Cloud backup my data? 

For the [paid tiers](/pricing), Surreal Cloud automatically backs up your data daily with a 7 day retention period to ensure data durability and availability.

### How often can I increase the disk size of my instance?

You can increase the disk size of your instance once every 6 hours.

### What are the limits of the Surreal Cloud?

It is not currently possible to configure [CLI](/docs/surrealdb/cli) arguments or environment variables in Surreal Cloud.

Surreal Cloud nodes run with the default [SurrealDB capabilities](/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities) except for allowing network access to the Cloud API for the purposes of authenticating with Surrealist.

Surreal Cloud does not currently allow outgoing network requests, scripting, or guest access. All functions, RPC methods and all HTTP routes are allowed.

[GraphQL support](/docs/surrealdb/querying/graphql) is not yet enabled on Surreal Cloud instances.

> [!NOTE]
> Free Tier instances surpassing the 1GB free storage allowance will be limited to data retrieval only. Unless you upgrade to a paid tier, you will not be able to create new data.

## Security

### How secure is Surreal Cloud?

Surreal Cloud is designed with security in mind and aims to provide robust protection for your data and applications. As detailed within our [Security Addendum](/legal/security-addendum), the platform leverages industry-standard security practices, including encryption at rest and in transit, network isolation, access controls and monitoring. For authentication, Surreal Cloud supports multi-factor authentication through the available identity providers that offer it to their users. We are compliant with ISO 27001, and are working towards achieving SOC 2 compliance, with plans to expand to other industry-specific compliance programs in the future, such as HIPAA or PCI DSS.

Additionally, Surreal Cloud is built on top of SurrealDB, which provides powerful and flexible [security features](/docs/surrealdb/security/summary#product) that are available to all Surreal Cloud customers. SurrealDB is developed and maintained following modern [security practices](/docs/surrealdb/security/summary#process) to ensure early detection of security vulnerabilities and other security issues.

We are happy to discuss the security of Surreal Cloud with customers assessing usage of the service for their workloads during the beta phase. Please [Contact Us.](/pricing/contact)

### How can I report a security issue in Surreal Cloud?

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Surreal Cloud or SurrealDB, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly address the issue. Please report any security issue to [security@surrealdb.com](mailto:security@surrealdb.com). For security issues in SurrealDB, please submit a report via [Github Security Advisories](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/security/advisories) rather than posting a public issue in GitHub.

We ask that you...

- ... privately disclose the details of any potential vulnerability to SurrealDB.
- ... provide enough information to reproduce the vulnerability in your report.

We ask that you refrain from...

- ... disclosing the details of a vulnerability publicly or to third parties.
- ... exploiting a vulnerability beyond what is strictly necessary to verify its existence.
- ... running automated security tools against SurrealDB infrastructure without permission.

We commit to...

- ... acknowledging your report within three business days of the date of communication.
- ... verifying the issue and keeping you informed of the progress toward its resolution.
- ... handling your report and any data you share with us with strict confidentiality.
- ... abstaining from legal action against you for any report made following this policy.
- ... crediting you in any relevant public security advisory unless you desire otherwise.

### How do I configure user authentication?
Surreal Cloud allows users to authenticate directly into their instances from Surrealist using a pre-defined access method. Once connected to your Instance, you may [define users](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) or [access methods](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access) that users can use to access your Instance or specific namespaces or databases using any of the available [interfaces](/docs/surrealdb/integration), the [SurrealDB CLI](/docs/surrealdb/cli) or [Surrealist](https://surrealist.app/query).

### Can I use my own encryption keys?
Currently, any encryption keys used to encrypt data at rest are managed by Surreal Cloud. Since the architecture technically supports it, we may consider allowing customers to associate their own Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) to be used to encrypt data at rest in the future. If you are interested in CMEK, please, contact us.

### Can I limit who can reach my instances over the internet?
All instances created in Surreal Cloud are publicly reachable over the internet and currently rely exclusively on the authentication and authorization mechanisms that are defined within the instance to prevent access to their data. We plan on providing the ability to restrict network access to instances as well as the ability to limit the [capabilities](/docs/surrealdb/security/capabilities) of each instance in the future. If your use case requires private network access to the instances, please, contact us.
