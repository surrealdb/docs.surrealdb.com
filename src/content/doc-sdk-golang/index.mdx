The SurrealDB SDK for Golang is the primary SDK for interacting with SurrealDB from server-side applications, systems, and APIs. You can use the Golang SDK to interact with your SurrealDB database instances, or to run SurrealDB as an embedded database within your Golang application, with functionality for executing queries, managing data, running database functions, authenticating to the database, building user signup and authentication functionality, and subscribing to data changes with live queries.

To contribute to the SDK code, submit an Issue or Pull Request in the [surrealdb.go](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb.go) repository. To contribute to this documentation, submit an Issue or Pull Request in the [docs.surrealdb.com](https://github.com/surrealdb/docs.surrealdb.com) repository.

The SDK requires Golang version `1.18` or greater, is available as a [go.dev package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb.go), and works seamlessly with SurrealDB versions `>v2.0.0`, ensuring compatibility with the latest version.
