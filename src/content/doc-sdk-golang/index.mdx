# Golang SDK

The SurrealDB SDK for Golang is the primary SDK for interacting with SurrealDB from server-side applications, systems, and APIs. You can use the Golang SDK to interact with your SurrealDB database instances, or to run SurrealDB as an embedded database within your Golang application, with functionality for executing queries, managing data, running database functions, authenticating to the database, building user signup and authentication functionality, and subscribing to data changes with live queries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SDK requires Golang version `1.18` or greater, and is available as a [go.dev package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb.go).

> [!NOTE]
> The SDK works seamlessly with SurrealDB versions `v2.0.0` to <Version />, ensuring compatibility with the latest version.

> [!WARNING]
> This API is not yet fully stabilized and may be subject to change until the SDK reaches `1.0.0`.
