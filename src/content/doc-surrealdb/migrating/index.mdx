# Migrating from other databases and data types to SurrealDB

This section details how to map data, queries and concepts you may know from other databases and datatypes into SurrealDB.

All of the sources in this section of the documentation can be automatically imported to SurrealDB using the [Surreal Sync](https://github.com/surrealdb/surreal-sync/) tool. In addition, [CSV data](/docs/surrealdb/migrating/csv) can be automatically imported into Surrealist using its own [built-in functionality](/docs/surrealist/concepts/explore-database-records#importing-a-csv-file).

For other sources not yet supported, consider beginning by exporting the database as JSON which can be [imported on the command line](/docs/surrealdb/cli/import). Alternatively, you can use [one of the many available SDKs](/docs/surrealdb/querying/sdks) to access your existing database and transfer its content directly to a SurrealDB instance.
