# CLI tool

The SurrealDB command-line tool can be used to [start a single SurrealDB instance](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start), [export a dataset as a `.surql` file](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export), [import SurrealQL](/docs/surrealdb/cli/import) into a local or remote database, or [upgrade](/docs/surrealdb/cli/upgrade) to a new version of SurrealDB.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Before using the CLI, you will need to [install SurrealDB](/docs/surrealdb/installation).

## Getting Started

The CLI, allowing you to use the `surreal` command from your terminal or command prompt. This documentation provides detailed information on each command, including usage examples and options.

When starting with the CLI, the most commonly used commands are [`surreal start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) to start the server, along with [`surreal sql`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) to open up an interactive shell to make queries. Other common commands are [`surreal upgrade`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/upgrade) to switch between versions of SurrealDB, and [`surreal import`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/import) and [`surreal export`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export) to import and export your data.


For a quickstart, [`surreal start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) and [`surreal sql`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) will be enough to get you started.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root
```
Unless you specify otherwise, the CLI will start a database in memory that serves at `127.0.0.1:8000 or (http://localhost:8000)`. This database has a single root user named `root` and a password `root`.

In another window, you can then open up an interactive shell to make queries using the  `surreal sql` command.

```bash
surreal sql --endpoint http://localhost:8000 --namespace ns --database db --username root --password root --pretty
```

> [!WARNING]
> Using generic usernames and passwords is not recommended for production use. Please replace the authentication credentials with your own.

This will start an interactive shell to make queries. Since you are logged in as the root user inside a namespace called `ns` and a database called `db`, with pretty (easily readable) output per query.

You can then try out a few queries and see the output.

```bash
ns/db> CREATE person SET age = 20;
ns/db> CREATE person SET age = 30;
ns/db> SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 25;
```

```bash title="Output"
[
	{
		age: 20,
		id: person:6jodx8xv39jsxdgykt0t
	}
]

[
	{
		age: 30,
		id: person:10bcq2owseyqqoinjgxl
	}
]

[
	{
		age: 30,
		id: person:10bcq2owseyqqoinjgxl
	}
]
```

Alternatively, you can start a local database in memory with the command below. This will start a database in memory with a single namespace called `test` and a database called `test`. Please replace the username and password with your own. 

```bash
surreal sql --endpoint memory --namespace test --database test --auth-level root --username username --password password
```

>[!WARNING]
> The above command will start a database in memory with a single namespace called `test` and a database called `test` and allow root access to the database. Using generic usernames and passwords is not recommended for production use.

We hope that the SurrealDB CLI simplifies your interactions with SurrealDB and empowers you to efficiently manage your databases and clusters. Let's dive into the CLI section and explore its capabilities!
