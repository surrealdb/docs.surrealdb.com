The help command displays help information and instructions on the command-line tool and its arguments.

> [!NOTE: BEFORE YOU START]
> Make sure you’ve [installed SurrealDB](/docs/surrealdb/installation) — it should only take a second!

## Show the command-line help information

To see the general help information for the command-line tool, in a terminal run the `surreal help` command without any further arguments. This command gives general information on the other functionality which can be run with the command-line tool.

```bash
surreal help
```

The output of the above command:

```bash
 .d8888b.                                             888 8888888b.  888888b.

## Getting help on individual commands

For individual commands, such as `surreal start` and `surreal sql`, a help prompt can be displayed by adding the `--help` flag. This flag overrides all other flags, and thus can be added to the end of any command regardless of length.

```bash
surreal start --help
surreal start --user root --pass root --strict --help
```
