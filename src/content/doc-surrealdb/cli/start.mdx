## Positional argument

In the `surreal start` command, the path argument is used to specify the location of the database. If no argument is given, the default of `memory` for non-persistent storage in memory is assumed. 

When using a path argument with SurrealDB, we recommend not using the `file://` prefix. Instead, please use [`surrealkv://`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start#surrealkv-beta) or [`rocksdb://`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start#surrealkv-beta) as the path argument. If you are using the `file://` prefix, the database will start with the following warning:

```bash 
file:// is deprecated, please use surrealkv:// or rocksdb://
```

## Getting started

This example will show how to host a SurrealDB server with the `surreal start` command, and then access the Surreal DB server using the [`surreal sql` command](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql).

To start a SurrealDB server, run the `surreal start` command, using the options below. This example stores the database in memory, with a username and password, hosted at `127.0.0.1:8000` (the default location).

```bash
surreal start memory --user my_username --pass my_password
```

The server is actively running, and should be left alone until you want to stop hosting the SurrealDB server.


> [!NOTE]
> The message "Started web server on 127.0.0.1:8000", indicates where the server is being hosted and must be accessed by clients. The location `127.0.0.1:8000` is the default, and can be manually changed by specifying the `--bind` option of the `surreal start` command.


To access the SurrealDB server that you have started hosting, open a separate terminal which will act as the "client", while the previous terminal is still running the `surreal start` command described above. 

In the new terminal, run the [`surreal sql` command](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) using the options shown below.

```bash
surreal sql --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8000 --namespace my_namespace --database my_database --auth-level root --username my_username --password my_password
```

Ensure that the hosting location indicated by the output of the `surreal start` command is passed to the `--endpoint` argument, and that you specify the same `--username` and `--password` as in the `surreal start` command.

The above example also selects a namespace and database so that you can immediately start entering queries if you wish. See the documentation of the [`surreal sql` command](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) for more information.


## Strict mode

SurrealDB supports the ability to startup in strict mode. When running in strict mode, all `NAMESPACE`, `DATABASE`, and `TABLE` definitions will not be created automatically when data is inserted. Instead, if the selected namespace, database, or table has not been specifically defined, then the query will return an error.

```bash
surreal start --strict --log debug memory
```

## RocksDB

To start a SurrealDB instance with RocksDB as the storage engine include the `rocksdb://` prefix in the path argument. 

```bash
surreal start -u root -p root rocksdb://mydb
```



## SurrealKV (Beta)

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

SurrealKV is an embedded ACID-compliant key-value storage engine with built-in versioning, that allows for historical or temporal querying. It is built entirely in Rust - like the rest of SurrealDB.

Since SurrealKV supports historical/temporal querying, you can user the `VERSION` clause when [selecting](/docs/surrealql/statements/select#the-version-clause) or [creating](/docs/surrealql/statements/create#version) data to access historical data. Learn more in the [SurrealQL documentation](/docs/surrealql/statements/select#version). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although included in SurrealDB `2.0`, the storage engine itself is considered beta, and may require additional development and testing before it is ready for production use.

To start a SurrealDB instance with SurrealKV, run the following command:
```bash
surreal start -u root -p root  surrealkv://mydb
```

```bash

### Performance characteristics and trade-offs

#### Strengths

SurrealKV offers several notable performance advantages:

From a latency perspective, the system provides constant-time retrieval operations through direct offset lookups. Write operations are primarily bound by sequential I/O performance, and the system maintains minimal disk seeks during normal operation.

In terms of throughput properties, SurrealKV excels through its sequential write patterns that maximize I/O bandwidth utilization. The system's concurrent read operations effectively scale with available CPU cores, while range queries are optimized through the trie's prefix-based organization.

The recovery semantics are robust and predictable. During initial startup, the system performs a full segment scan to rebuild the index. Recovery and repair times scale proportionally with the total segment size and last active segment size, respectively. Data integrity is maintained through CRC verification during recovery. The system handles partial writes effectively by using CRC32 calculations from record fields to detect truncated writes, identifying and truncates incomplete records during recovery, and ensuring transaction logs are recovered to the last valid record boundary.

Operationally, SurrealKV offers significant advantages. The compaction process runs concurrently with normal operations, and the append-only format makes replication procedures straightforward.

#### Limitations

SurrealKV does have some important limitations to consider:

Memory management is a key consideration, as the index must reside in memory. Memory usage scales with the number of unique keys, key size distribution, and the number of versions per key.

Write amplification is another factor to consider. Each update creates a new version, requiring periodic compaction. During compaction, space usage temporarily increases.

Range query performance varies depending on several factors: key distribution, version history depth, and range size. Large ranges may require multiple disk reads to complete.

From an operational standpoint, regular compaction is necessary for space reclamation. System restart time increases with log size, and high-cardinality keyspaces can create memory pressure.

#### Performance implications

SurrealKV is particularly well-suited for certain use cases. It performs optimally with write-intensive workloads, point query dominated patterns, prefix-based access patterns, and time-series data with version tracking.

However, some scenarios may not be ideal for SurrealKV. These include memory-constrained environments, very large key spaces, scan-heavy workloads, and situations involving random updates to large datasets.

## Authentication

When starting a SurrealDB instance, authentication is enabled by default, and your user credentials will be required to connect. If you are starting a new instance, the user credentials you use to run the `start` command will [define a new root user](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user#roles) with the[`OWNER`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user#roles) role.

```bash
surreal start -u root -p root
```

### Unauthenticated mode

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

Using the `-- unauthenticated` flag, you can also start a SurrealDB instance in unauthenticated mode. By doing so, authentication will be disabled. In this mode, any guest user is considered to have the same permissions as a root user with the [`OWNER`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user#roles) role.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend enabling authentication when running SurrealDB in production or in publicly exposed ways. Failure to do so may result in unauthorized access.

To start a SurrealDB instance in unauthenticated mode, run the following command:

```bash
surreal start --unauthenticated
```

## Identification headers

<Since v="v2.0.0" />

By default, SurrealDB includes headers in the HTTP response that identify the server name and version. You can suppress these headers by using the `--no-identification-headers` flag.

```bash
surreal start --no-identification-headers
```

## Further examples

As `surreal start` is the command with by far the largest number of options, a few more examples will help give an idea of what sort of configurations are available.

An instance with a single root user, able to connect to the internet but unable to use three functions:

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root --allow-net --deny-funcs "crypto::md5, http::post, http::delete"
```

An instance with more verbose logging that uses RocksDB as its storage engine:

```bash
surreal start --log debug rocksdb:mydatabase.db
```

An instance with all capabilities denied except a few functions and a single endpoint:

```bash
surreal start --deny-all --allow-funcs "array, string, crypto::argon2, http::get" --allow-net api.example.com:443
```

An instance with a different default address, less verbose logging level, and ability to use JavaScript functions:

```bash
surreal start --bind 0.0.0.0:2218 --log warn --allow-scripting
```

## Command help

To see the help information and usage instructions, in a terminal run the `surreal start --help` command without any further arguments. This command gives general information on the arguments, inputs, and additional options for the `start` command.

```bash
surreal start --help
```

The output of the above command:

```

Capabilities:
  -A, --allow-all
          Allow all capabilities except for those more specifically denied
          
          [env: SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_ALL=]

      --allow-scripting
          Allow execution of embedded scripting functions

      --allow-funcs [<ALLOW_FUNCS>...]
          Allow execution of all functions except for functions that are specifically denied. Alternatively, you can provide a comma-separated list of function names to
          allow
          Specifically denied functions and function families prevail over any other allowed function execution.
          Function names must be in the form <family>[::<name>]. For example:
           - 'http' or 'http::*' -> Include all functions in the 'http' family
           - 'http::get' -> Include only the 'get' function in the 'http' family
          
          
          [env: SURREAL_CAPS_ALLOW_FUNC=]

      --allow-net [<ALLOW_NET>...]
          Allow all outbound network connections except for network targets that are specifically denied. Alternatively, you can provide a comma-separated list of

          Specifically denied network targets prevail over any other allowed outbound network connections.
          Targets must be in the form of <host>[:<port>], <ipv4|ipv6>[/<mask>]. For example:
           - 'surrealdb.com', '127.0.0.1' or 'fd00::1' -> Match outbound connections to these hosts on any port
           - 'surrealdb.com:80', '127.0.0.1:80' or 'fd00::1:80' -> Match outbound connections to these hosts on port 80
           - '10.0.0.0/8' or 'fd00::/8' -> Match outbound connections to any host in these networks

          [env: SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_GUESTS=]

      --deny-funcs [<DENY_FUNCS>...]
          Deny execution of all functions except for functions that are specifically allowed. Alternatively, you can provide a comma-separated list of function names to
          deny.
          Specifically allowed functions and function families prevail over a general denial of function execution.
          Function names must be in the form <family>[::<name>]. For example:
           - 'http' or 'http::*' -> Include all functions in the 'http' family
           - 'http::get' -> Include only the 'get' function in the 'http' family
          
          
          [env: SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_FUNC=]

      --deny-net [<DENY_NET>...]
          Deny all outbound network connections except for network targets that are specifically allowed. Alternatively, you can provide a comma-separated list of
          network targets to deny.
          Specifically allowed network targets prevail over a general denial of outbound network connections.
          Targets must be in the form of <host>[:<port>], <ipv4|ipv6>[/<mask>]. For example:
           - 'surrealdb.com', '127.0.0.1' or 'fd00::1' -> Match outbound connections to these hosts on any port
           - 'surrealdb.com:80', '127.0.0.1:80' or 'fd00::1:80' -> Match outbound connections to these hosts on port 80
           - '10.0.0.0/8' or 'fd00::/8' -> Match outbound connections to any host in these networks

      --temporary-directory <TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY>
          Sets the directory for storing temporary database files
          
          [env: SURREAL_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY=]
```

## Using environment variables

When using the `surreal start` command, you can also use environment variables to set the values for the command-line flags. This is useful when you want to set the values for the command-line flags without having to pass them directly on the command line.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Most of the flags mentioned in the command output above also mention a corresponding [environment variables](/docs/surrealdb/cli/env#command-environment-variables). 
>
>
> For example, the `--temporary-directory` flag can be configured with the `SURREAL_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY` environment variable instead. 

For more on the environment variables available for CLI commands or SurrealDB instances in general, see the [environment variables](/docs/surrealdb/cli/env#command-environment-variables) page.
