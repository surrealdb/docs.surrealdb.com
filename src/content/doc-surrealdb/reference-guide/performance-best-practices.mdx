# Performance Best Practices

This guide outlines some key performance best practices for using SurrealDB `v2.x.x`. While SurrealDB offers powerful and flexible features to help you meet your desired performance standards, your use of those features will ultimately determine whether or not you meet them.

To achieve the best performance from SurrealDB, there are a number of configuration options and runtime design choices to be considered which can improve and affect the performance of the database.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of performance best practices you should consider when building services and applications with SurrealDB to help you address common performance challenges while preventing frequent pitfalls.


## SurrealDB architecture

While SurrealDB is a [multi-model database](/blog/what-are-multi-model-databases), at its core, SurrealDB stores data in documents on transactional key-value stores.

This means that SurrealDB is a general-purpose databases optimised for a combination of various workloads such as operational, AI and real-time workloads.

While SurrealDB can perform well with real-time and advanced analytical workloads, its architecture is not columnar based. Therefore its not optimised for large ad-hoc analytical queries in the same way as specialised columnar data warehouses.

SurrealDB is built using a layered approach, with compute separated from the storage. This allows us, if necessary, to scale up the compute layer, and the storage layer independently from each other.

## Running SurrealDB

### Using Surreal Cloud

The easiest way to run SurrealDB is using Surreal Cloud, which allows you to focus on building great products while we take care of running and maintaining it in the most performant and scalable way.

Read more about running SurrealDB [using Surreal Cloud](/cloud).

### Running SurrealDB as a server

When starting the SurrealDB server, it is important to run the server using the correct configuration options and
settings. For production environments or for performance benchmarking, the `--log` command-line argument or the
`SURREAL_LOG` environment variable should be set to `error`, `warn`, or `info` (the default option when not specified).

> [!NOTE]
>Other log verbosity levels (such as `debug`, `trace`, or `full`) are only for use in debugging, testing, or development scenarios. The verbosity of the log level impacts the performance by increasing the amount of information being logged for each single operation.

When starting up the SurrealDB binary ensure that the `--log` argument is omitted, or specifically set to the correct
log verbosity level. Additionally, ensure that the `rocksdb` storage engine is used to store data.

```sh
surreal start --log info rocksdb://path/to/mydatabase
```

When starting up the SurrealDB Docker container ensure that the `--log` argument is omitted, or specifically set to the
correct log verbosity level.

```sh
docker run --rm --pull always -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --log info rocksdb://path/to/mydatabase
```

### Running SurrealDB embedded in Rust

When running SurrealDB as an embedded database within Rust, using the correct release profile and memory allocator can
greatly improve the performance of the database core engine. In addition using an optimised asynchronous runtime
configuration can help speed up concurrent queries and increase database throughput.

In your project's `Cargo.toml` file, ensure that the release profile uses the following configuration:

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true
strip = true
opt-level = 3
panic = 'abort'
codegen-units = 1
```

In your project's `Cargo.toml` file, ensure that the `allocator` feature is enabled on the `surrealdb` dependency:

```toml
surrealdb = { version = "2", features = ["allocator", "storage-mem", "storage-surrealkv", "storage-rocksdb", "protocol-http", "protocol-ws", "rustls"] }
```

When running SurrealDB within your Rust code, ensure that the asynchronous runtime is configured correctly, making use
of multiple threads, an increased stack size, and an optimised number of threads:

```toml
tokio = { version = "1.41.1", features = ["sync", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

```rs
fn main() {
	tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
    .enable_all()
    .thread_stack_size(10 * 1024 * 1024) // 10MiB
    .build()
    .unwrap()
    .block_on(async {
      // Your application code
    })
}
```

### Running SurrealDB embedded in Tauri

When running SurrealDB as an embedded database within Rust, default options of Tauri can make SurrealDB run slower, as
it processes and outputs the database information logs. Configuring Tauri correctly, can result in much improved
performance with the core database engine and any queries which are run on SurrealDB.

When building a desktop application with Tauri, ensure that the Tauri plugin log is disabled by configuring the
`tauri.conf.json` file:

```json
{
	"plugins": {
		"logger": {
			"enabled": false
			}
	}
}
```

Alternatively you can disable logs at compile time when building your Tauri app:

```bash
TAURI_LOG_LEVEL=off cargo tauri build
```

## Performing queries

### Selecting single records

Certain queries in SurrealDB can be more efficiently written in certain ways which ensure that full table scans or indexes are not necessary when executing the query.

In traditional SQL, the following query can be used to query for a particular row from a table:

```surql
SELECT *
FROM user
WHERE id = 19374837491;
```

However, currently in SurrealDB this query will perform a scan to find the record, although this is not necessary and you don't need to index the id field when using SurrealDB. Instead the following query can be used to select the specific record without needing to perform any scan:

```surql
SELECT *
FROM user:19374837491;
```

### Selecting multiple records

In traditional SQL, the following queries can be used to query for getting particular rows from a table:

```surql
-- Selecting individual IDs
SELECT *
FROM user
WHERE id = 19374837491
   OR id = 12647931632;
```

```surql
-- Selecting a range of IDs
SELECT *
FROM user
WHERE id >= 12647931632
   AND id <= 19374837491;
```

However, currently in SurrealDB this query will perform a scan to find the record, although this is not necessary and you don't need to index the id field when using SurrealDB. Instead the following query can be used to select the specific record without needing to perform any scan:

```surql
-- Selecing indiviudal IDs
SELECT *
FROM user:19374837491, user:12647931632;
```

```surql
-- Selecting a range of IDs
SELECT *
FROM user:12647931632..=19374837491;
```

### Simplifying logic in `WHERE` clauses

If a `WHERE` clause cannot be avoided, performance can still be improved by optimizing the portion after the `WHERE` clause. As a boolean check is the simplest possible operation, having a boolean field that can be used in a `WHERE` clause can significantly improve performance.

```surql
-- Fill up the database a bit with 10,000 records
CREATE |person:10000| SET
    random_data = rand::string(1000),
    data_length = random_data.len(),
    is_short = data_length < 10 RETURN NONE;
-- Add one outlier
CREATE person:one SET
    random_data = "HI!",
    data_length = random_data.len(),
    is_short = data_length < 10 RETURN NONE;

-- Function call + compare operation: slowest
SELECT * FROM person WHERE random_data.len() < 10;
-- Compare operation: much faster
SELECT * FROM person WHERE data_length < 10;
-- Boolean check: even faster
SELECT * FROM person WHERE is_short;
-- Direct record access: almost instantaneous
SELECT * FROM person:one;
```

## Using indexes

SurrealDB has native built-in support for a number of different index types, without leveraging external libraries or
implementations.

With native support for indexes in the core database engine, SurrealDB leverages indexes where possible within the SurrealQL query language, without pushing queries down to a separate indexing engine. 

In addition, data is indexed in the same way for embedded systems, single-node database servers, and multi-node highly-available clusters, ensuring that the same indexing functionality is available regardless of the SurrealDB deployment model. 

Indexing support in SurrealDB is in active development, with work focusing on increased support for additional operators, compound indexes, additional index types, and overall improved index performance.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently no indexes are used when performing `UPDATE` or `DELETE` queries on large table, even where indexes are defined.
> We'll be adding support for indexes within `UPDATE`, `UPSERT`, and `DELETE` statements in SurrealDB release `v2.3.0`.

In the meantime, you can improve the performance of `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements by combining these with a `SELECT` statement.

To improve the performance of an `UPDATE` statement, use a `SELECT` statement within a subquery, selecting only the `id`
field. This will use any defined indexes:

```surql
UPDATE (SELECT id FROM user WHERE age < 18)
SET adult = false;
```

To improve the performance of an `DELETE` statement, use a `SELECT` statement within a subquery, selecting only the `id`
field. This will use any defined indexes:

```surql
DELETE (SELECT id FROM user WHERE age < 18);
```

### Index strategies explained

When using `SELECT`, SurrealDB uses a query planner whose role is to identify if it can use the index to speed the
execution of the query.

Without indexes, SurrealDB will operate a `SELECT` query on a table by using the table iterator. It mainly scans every
record of a given table. If there is a condition (`WHERE ...`), an ordering (`ORDER BY ...`), or an aggregation (`GROUP
BY ...`), it will load the value in memory and execute the operation. This process is commonly called a "table full
scan".

```surql
SELECT *
FROM user
WHERE age < 18
EXPLAIN;
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		detail: {
			table: 'user'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Table'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			type: 'Memory'
		},
		operation: 'Collector'
	}
]
```

Under certain conditions, if an index exists, and the condition or ordering involves exclusively fields that are
indexed, the query planner will suggest an execution plan that involves one or multiple indexes to achieve these
potential optimisations:

- Only collect records that match the condition(s), as opposed to performing a table full scan.
- As the index already stores the records in order, the scanning collects the records pre-ordered, sparing an additional ordering phase.

```surql
DEFINE INDEX idx_user_age ON user FIELDS age;

SELECT age
FROM user
WHERE age > 18
EXPLAIN;
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		detail: {
			plan: {
				from: {
					inclusive: false,
					value: 18
				},
				index: 'idx_user_age',
				to: {
					inclusive: false,
					value: NONE
				}
			},
			table: 'user'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Index'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			type: 'Memory'
		},
		operation: 'Collector'
	}
]
```

If there are several clauses separated with `OR` operators, the query planner may do several index-based iterations:

```surql
SELECT age
FROM user
WHERE age < 7
   OR age > 77
EXPLAIN;
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		detail: {
			plan: {
				from: {
					inclusive: false,
					value: NONE
				},
				index: 'idx_user_age',
				to: {
					inclusive: false,
					value: 7
				}
			},
			table: 'user'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Index'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			plan: {
				from: {
					inclusive: false,
					value: 77
				},
				index: 'idx_user_age',
				to: {
					inclusive: false,
					value: NONE
				}
			},
			table: 'user'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Index'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			type: 'Memory'
		},
		operation: 'Collector'
	}
]
```

### Use `UPSERT` to take advantage of unique indexes

`UPSERT` statements have a unique performance advantage when paired with a unique index.

A unique index on its own is used to prevent more than one record from containing the same data, such as a name or email address.

```surql
DEFINE INDEX email_index ON user FIELDS email UNIQUE;

CREATE user SET email = "bob@bob.com";
CREATE user SET email = "bob@bob.com";
```

```surql title="Output"
"Database index `email_index` already contains 'bob@bob.com', with record `user:g7s070gqvh3lj7fdp26w`"
```

An `UPSERT` statement works like a `CREATE` statement in this case as well, except that if the value for `email` is already present, it will modify the existing record instead of creating a new one. An `UPSERT` will only fail in this case if a user attempts to upsert to a certain record ID (like `user:bob` instead of just the `user` table) when another record holds this value.

The key point here is that in either case, `UPSERT` is using the index to find the record instead of a table scan.

```surql
DEFINE INDEX email_index ON user FIELDS email UNIQUE;

CREATE user SET email = "bob@bob.com";

-- Checks index, finds existing user via email "bob@bob.com", modifies it
UPSERT user SET email = "bob@bob.com", name = "Bob Bobson";

-- Checks index, fails as a new `user:bob` cannot be created with the same email
UPSERT user:bob SET email = "bob@bob.com", name = "Bob Bobson";
```

As such, when updating a single record on a table that contains a unique index, `UPSERT` is much more performant than `UPDATE`.

```surql
DEFINE INDEX email_index ON user FIELDS email UNIQUE;

-- Create 50,000 users to fill up the database
CREATE |user:50000| RETURN NONE;

-- Create Bob
CREATE user SET email = "bob@bob.com";

-- Don't do this: full table scan to find and update a record
UPDATE user SET name = "Bob Bobson" WHERE email = "bob@bob.com";

-- Do this instead: use the index instead to go directly to the record, no table scan
UPSERT user SET name = "Bob Bobson", email = "bob@bob.com";
```

### Index lookup on remote fields

SurrealDB document record IDs store both the table name and the record identifier. This design provides a
straightforward and consistent way to reference records across the database. One particularly powerful feature is the
ability to filter a table based on conditions that relate to a referenced table.

Here is a concrete example, where the statement `SELECT * FROM access WHERE user.role = 'admin'` will retrieve records
from the `access` table for which the referenced record in the `user` table has the `name` field set to 'admin'.

Consider the following example:

```surql
DEFINE FIELD user ON TABLE access TYPE record<user>;

CREATE user:1 SET name = 'foo', role = 'admin';
CREATE user:2 SET name = 'bar', role = 'admin';

CREATE access:A SET user = user:1;
CREATE access:B SET user = user:2;

SELECT *
FROM access
WHERE user.role = 'admin'
```

The query retrieves records from the `access` table whose associated record in the `user` table has the role `field` set
to 'admin'.

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		id: access:A,
		user: user:1
	},
	{
		id: access:B,
		user: user:2
	}
]
```

To optimize this query, you can create indexes on both the `user.role` field and the `access.user` field.
With these indexes, the query planner can leverage an index-based join strategy:

```surql
DEFINE INDEX idx_user_role ON TABLE user COLUMNS role;
DEFINE INDEX idx_access_user ON TABLE access COLUMNS user;

SELECT *
FROM access
WHERE user.role = 'admin' 
EXPLAIN;
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		detail: {
			plan: {
				index: 'idx_access_user',
				joins: [
					{
						index: 'idx_user_role',
						operator: '=',
						value: 'admin'
					}
				],
				operator: 'join'
			},
			table: 'access'
		},
		operation: 'Iterate Index'
	},
	{
		detail: {
			type: 'Memory'
		},
		operation: 'Collector'
	}
]
```
