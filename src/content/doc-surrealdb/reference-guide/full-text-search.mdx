# Full Text Search

SurrealDB offers a large variety of ways to work with text, from simple operators to fuzzy searching, customized ordering, full-text search and more. In this guide, we will cover comparing and sorting text, contains functions and operators, equality and fuzzy equality, regex matching, string functions, and full-text search. 

This will give you a comprehensive overview of the different ways to work with text in SurrealDB and which one to use in your specific use case.

## Comparing and sorting text

### In `SELECT` queries

The following example shows a few records created from an array of strings in an order that is sorted to the human eye: lowest to highest numbers, then A to Z.

```surql
FOR $word IN ['1', '2', '11', 'Ábaco', 'kitty', 'Zoo'] {
	CREATE data SET val = $word;
};
```

Inside a `SELECT` query, an `ORDER BY` clause can be used to order the output by one or more field names. For the above data, an ordered `SELECT` query looks like this.

```surql
SELECT VALUE val FROM data ORDER BY val;
```

However, in the case of strings, sorting is done by Unicode rank which often leads to output that seems out of order to the human eye. The output of the above query shows the following:

```surql title="Output"
[ '1', '11', '2', 'Zoo', 'kitty', 'Ábaco' ]
```

This is because:

* '11' is ordered before '2', because the first character in the string '2' is greater than the first character in the string '1'.
* 'Zoo' is ordered before 'kitty', because the first character in the string 'Zoo' is 'Z', number 0059 in the [list of Unicode characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Basic_Latin). A lowercase 'k' is 0076 on the list and thus "greater", while the 'Á', registered as the "Latin Capital letter A with acute", is 0129 on the list.

To sort strings in a more natural manner to the human eye, the keywords [`NUMERIC` and `COLLATE` (or both) can be used](/docs/surrealql/statements/select#sort-records-using-the-order-by-clause). `NUMERIC` will instruct strings that parse into numbers to be treated as such.

```surql
SELECT VALUE val FROM data ORDER BY val NUMERIC;
```

```surql title="Numberic strings now sorted as numbers"
[ '1', '2', '11', 'Zoo', 'kitty', 'Ábaco' ]
```

`COLLATE` instructs unicode strings to sort by alphabetic order, rather than Unicode order.

```surql
SELECT VALUE val FROM data ORDER BY val COLLATE;
```

```surql title="Output"
[ '1', '11', '2', 'Ábaco', 'kitty', 'Zoo' ]
```

And for the data in this example, `COLLATE NUMERIC` is likely what will be desired.

```surql
SELECT VALUE val FROM data ORDER BY val COLLATE NUMERIC;
```

```surql title="Output"
[ '1', '2', '11', 'Ábaco', 'kitty', 'Zoo' ]
```

### Sorting functions

As of SurrealDB `2.2.2`, the functions [`array::sort_natural()`, `array::sort_lexical()`, and `array::sort_lexical_natural()`](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/array) can be used on ad-hoc data to return the same output as the `COLLATE` and `NUMERIC` clauses in a [`SELECT` statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/select).

## Contains functions and operators

The most basic way to see if one string is contained inside another is to use the `IN` operator, or the [`string::contains()` function](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/string#stringcontains).

```surql
-- false
"Umple" IN "Rumplestiltskin";
string::contains("Rumplestiltskin", "Umple");
-- Same function using method syntax
"Rumplestiltskin".contains("Umple");

-- true
"umple" IN "Rumplestiltskin";
string::contains("Rumplestiltskin", "umple");
"Rumplestiltskin".contains("umple");
```

SurrealDB has a number of [operators](/docs/surrealql/operators) to determine if all or some of the values of one array are contained in another, such as `CONTAINSALL` and `CONTAINSANY`, or `ALLINSIDE` and `ANYINSIDE`. The operators with `CONTAINS` and `INSIDE` perform the same behaviour, just in the opposite order.

```surql
-- If 1,2,3 contains each item in 1,2...
[1,2,3] CONTAINSALL [1,2];
-- then each item in 1,2 is inside 1,2,3
[1,2] ALLINSIDE [1,2,3];
```

Because strings are essentially arrays of characters, these operators work with strings as well. 

> [!NOTE]
> The above capability was added in SurrealDB version `2.2.2`.

Both of these queries will return `true`.

```surql
"Rumplestiltskin" CONTAINSALL ["umple", "kin"];
"kin" ALLINSIDE "Rumplestiltskin";
["kin", "someotherstring"] ANYINSIDE "Rumplestiltskin";
```

## Equality and fuzzy equality

While strings can be compared for strict equality in the same way as with other values, fuzzy searching can also be used to return `true` if two strings are approximately equal. The fuzzy operators are:

* `~` to check if two strings have fuzzy equality
* `!~` to check if two strings do not have fuzzy equality
* `?~` to check if any strings have fuzzy equality
* `*~` to check if all strings have fuzzy equality

All of the following will return true.

```surql
"big" ~ "Big";
"big" !~ "small";
["Big", "small"] ?~ "big";
["Big", "big"] *~ "big";
```

Fuzzy matching is based on [the Smith-Waterman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm) that requires some time to understand. It is a convenient option due to the `~` operator, but can sometimes produce surprising results.

```surql
 -- true
"United Kingdom" ~ "United kingdom";
-- true (second string entirely contained in first)
"United Kingdom" ~ "ited";
-- Also true!
"United Kingdom" ~ "i";
-- false
"United Kingdom" ~ "United Kingdóm";
```

The [`string::similarity::fuzzy` function](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/string#stringsimilarityfuzzy) can be useful in this case, as it returns a number showing the similarity between strings, not just whether they count as a fuzzy match. In the following example, while the strings `ited` and `i` do have a similarity score above 0, they are ranked much lower than the better matches `United kingdom` and `United Kingdom`.

```surql
SELECT 
    $this AS word, 
    string::similarity::fuzzy("United Kingdom", $this) AS similarity
FROM ["United Kingdom", "United kingdom", "ited", "United Kingdóm", "i"]
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		similarity: 295,
		word: 'United Kingdom'
	},
	{
		similarity: 293,
		word: 'United kingdom'
	},
	{
		similarity: 75,
		word: 'ited'
	},
	{
		similarity: 15,
		word: 'i'
	},
	{
		similarity: 0,
		word: 'United Kingdóm'
	}
]
```

### Other similarity and distance functions

SurrealDB offers quite a few other algorithms inside the [string functions module](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/string) for distance or similarity comparison. They are:

* `string::distance::damerau_levenshtein()`
* `string::distance::normalized_damerau_levenshtein()`
* `string::distance::hamming()`
* `string::distance::levenshtein()`
* `string::distance::normalized_levenshtein()`
* `string::distance::osa_distance()`

* `string::similarity::jaro()`
* `string::similarity::jaro_winkler()`

Which of these functions to choose depends on your personal use case.

For example, fuzzy similarity and distance scores are not a measure of absolute equality and ordered similarity scores should only be used in comparisons against the same string. Take the following queries for example which return the score for the string "United" and "Unite":

```surql
-- return 131 and 111
string::similarity::fuzzy("United Kingdom", "United");
string::similarity::fuzzy("United Kingdom", "Unite");

-- also return 131 and 111
string::similarity::fuzzy("United", "United");
string::similarity::fuzzy("United", "Unite");
```

While the word "Unite" is clearly closer to the word "United" than it is to "United Kingdom", the algorithm used for this function only considers how much of the second string is found in the first string.

However, the `string::similarity::jaro()` function returns an output that approaches 1 if two strings are equal, making it a more apt solution when the first and second string may be entirely different. Using the same input strings as above shows that "Unite" is clearly the most similar of the strings that are not outright equal to "United".

```surql
-- 0.8095238095238096f
string::similarity::jaro("United Kingdom", "United");
-- 0.7857142857142857f
string::similarity::jaro("United Kingdom", "Unite");
-- 1
string::similarity::jaro("United", "United");
-- 0.9444444444444445f
string::similarity::jaro("United", "Unite");
```

Another example of the large difference between algorithms is the Hamming distance algorithm, which only compares strings of equal length.

```surql
-- Error: strings have different length
string::distance::hamming("United Kingdom", "United");
-- Returns 0
string::distance::hamming("United", "United");
-- Returns 1
string::distance::hamming("United", "Unitéd");
-- Returns 6
string::distance::hamming("United", "uNITED");
```

## Regex matching

The `string::matches()` function can be used to perform regex matching on a string.

```surql
-- true
string::matches("Cat", "[HC]at");
-- Also true
string::matches("Hat", "[HC]at");
```

## Other string functions

SurrealDB has a large number of [string functions](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/string) that can be used manually to refine string searching, such as `string::lowercase()`, `string::starts_with()`, and `string::ends_with()`.

```surql
SELECT 
    $this AS word, 
    $this.lowercase() = "sleek" AS is_sleek
FROM ["sleek", "SLEEK", "Sleek", "sleeek"];
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		is_sleek: true,
		word: 'sleek'
	},
	{
		is_sleek: true,
		word: 'SLEEK'
	},
	{
		is_sleek: true,
		word: 'Sleek'
	},
	{
		is_sleek: false,
		word: 'sleeek'
	}
]
```

For more customized text searching, full-text search can be used.

## Full-text search

Full-Text search supports text matching, proximity searches, result ranking, and keyword highlighting, making it a much more comprehensive solution when precise text searching is required.

It is also [ACID-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID), which ensures data integrity and reliability.

### Defining an analyzer

The first step to using full-text search is to [define an analyzer](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/analyzer) using a `DEFINE ANALYZER` statement. An analyzer is not defined on a table, but a set of tokenizers (to break up text) and filters (to modify text).

The `DEFINE ANALYZER` page contains a detailed explanation of each type of tokenizer and analyzer to choose from. To define the analyzer that most suits your needs, it is recommended to use the [`search::analyze`](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/search#searchanalyze) function which returns the output of an analyzer for an input string.

Take the following analyzer for example, which uses `blank` to split a string by whitespace, and `edgengram(3, 10)` to output all of the instances of the first three to ten letters of a word.

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER blank_edgengram TOKENIZERS blank FILTERS edgengram(3, 10);
search::analyze("blank_edgengram", "The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.");
```

The output includes strings like 'turns,' and 'legend.', which include punctuation marks.

```surql title="Output"
['The', 'Whe', 'Whee', 'Wheel', 'Tim', 'Time', 'tur', 'turn', 'turns', 'turns,', 'and', 'Age', 'Ages', 'com', 'come', 'and', 'pas', 'pass', 'pass,', 'lea', 'leav', 'leavi', 'leavin', 'leaving', 'mem', 'memo', 'memor', 'memori', 'memorie', 'memories', 'tha', 'that', 'bec', 'beco', 'becom', 'become', 'leg', 'lege', 'legen', 'legend', 'legend.']
```

If this is not desired, some looking through the `DEFINE ANALYZER` page will turn up another tokenizer called `punct` that can be included, now creating an analyzer that splits on whitespace as well as punctuation.

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER blank_edgengram TOKENIZERS blank, punct FILTERS edgengram(3, 10);
search::analyze("blank_edgengram", "The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.");
```

```surql title="Output"
['The', 'Whe', 'Whee', 'Wheel', 'Tim', 'Time', 'tur', 'turn', 'turns', 'and', 'Age', 'Ages', 'com', 'come', 'and', 'pas', 'pass', 'lea', 'leav', 'leavi', 'leavin', 'leaving', 'mem', 'memo', 'memor', 'memori', 'memorie', 'memories', 'tha', 'that', 'bec', 'beco', 'becom', 'become', 'leg', 'lege', 'legen', 'legend']
```

#### Tokenizers and filters

The available tokenizers and filters are as follows:

* Tokenizers `blank`, `camel`, `punct` to split by whitespace, camelcase, and punctuation. The `class` tokenizer splits when a class change is detected, such as letter to number, space to letter, punctuation to letter, and so on.
* Filters `ascii`, `lowercase`, `uppercase` to change to ASCII, lowercase, and uppercase.

The `ngram` filter is similar to the `edgengram` filter above in that it takes a minimum and maximum length, but instead moves from character to character inside a string as it attempts to find all the possible outputs in between these two lengths.

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER example_analyzer FILTERS ngram(1,4);
search::analyze("example_analyzer", "cars!");
```

Here is the output modified slightly to show the output of the `ngram` filter at each step of the way.

```surql title="Output"
[
	'c', 'ca', 'car', 'cars',
	'a', 'ar', 'ars', 'ars!',
	'r', 'rs', 'rs!',
	's', 's!',
	'!'
]
```

The `snowball` and `mapper` filters are the most complex and versatile.

#### The `snowball` filter

The snowball filter is used to perform stemming: the reduction of a word to as basic and universal a form as possible. It is available for the languages Arabic, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, and Turkish.

Stemming involves using an algorithm to reduce a word, but is unable to incorporate complex changes like the plural and verbal vowel changes in English.

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER snowball_test TOKENIZERS blank,punct FILTERS snowball(english);
search::analyze("snowball_test", "
    manager managing management
    running ran 
    foot feet
    introspective
    introspection
    introspected
");
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	'manag',
	'manag',
	'manag',
	'run',
	'ran',
	'foot',
	'feet',
	'introspect',
	'introspect',
	'introspect'
]
```

Stemming is particularly useful in languages with complex but regular declension, such as Finnish. In the following example, the snowball filter is able to turn all declined forms of the word "talo" (house) into its root form.

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER snowball_test TOKENIZERS blank,punct FILTERS snowball(finnish);
search::analyze("snowball_test", "talo talon taloa talossa talostani taloonsa talolla talolta talolle talona taloksi taloin talotta taloineen");
```

```surql title="Output"
['talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talo', 'talot', 'talo']
```

#### The `mapper` filter

The `mapper` filter is the most customizable of all, involving a list of strings and the strings they are to be mapped to. This filter requires a path to a text file, inside which each base form is followed by a word to map to it, separated by a comma.

```text title="mapper.txt"
run	ran
foot	feet
```

In the case of the above example, the `mapper` will allow the output to show the base forms of the words "ran" and "feet".

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER mapper TOKENIZERS blank FILTERS snowball(english),mapper('mapper.txt');
search::analyze("mapper", "
    manager managing management
    running ran 
    foot feet
    introspective
    introspection
    introspected
");
```

```surql
[
	'manag',
	'manag',
	'manag',
	'run',
	'run',
	'foot',
	'foot',
	'introspect',
	'introspect',
	'introspect'
]
```

The word `mapper` was intentionally chosen to be ambiguous, as this feature can be used to map any string to another string. It could be used for example to map cities to provinces, planets to stars, hieroglyphs to English words, and so on.

```text title="mapper.txt"
seated_man	𓀀
man_with_hand_to_mouth	𓀁
seated_woman	𓁐
goddess_with_feather	𓁦
```

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER mapper TOKENIZERS blank FILTERS mapper('mapper.txt');
search::analyze("mapper", "𓀀 𓁦");
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	'seated_man',
	'goddess_with_feather'
]
```

### Defining a Full-Text index

Once a search analyzer is defined, it can be applied to the fields of a table to make them searchable by [defining an index](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/indexes#full-text-search-index) that uses the `SEARCH ANALYZER` clause. Having a full-text index in place makes it possible to use the `@@` operator (the `MATCHES` operator).

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER my_analyzer
  TOKENIZERS class
  FILTERS lowercase, ascii;

DEFINE INDEX body_index ON TABLE article FIELDS body SEARCH ANALYZER my_analyzer;
DEFINE INDEX title_index ON TABLE article FIELDS title SEARCH ANALYZER my_analyzer;

CREATE article SET title = "Machine Learning!", body = "Machine learning, or ML, is all the rage these days. Developers are...";
CREATE article SET title = "History of machines", body = "The earliest 'machine' used by our ancestors was a simple sharpened stone tool. It was...";

SELECT body, title FROM article WHERE body @@ "machine" OR title @@ "machine";
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		body: 'Machine learning, or ML, is all the rage these days. Developers are...',
		title: 'Machine Learning!'
	},
	{
		body: "The earliest 'machine' used by our ancestors was a simple sharpened stone tool. It was...",
		title: 'History of machines'
	}
]
```

To use highlighting and best match scoring on searches, the `BM25` and `HIGHLIGHTS` clauses can be added to the `DEFINE INDEX` statement. These enable you use the [`search::highlight`](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/search#searchhighlight) and [`search::score`](/docs/surrealql/functions/database/search#searchscore) functions.

Inside a query, the `@@` operator takes a number that is matched with the same number passed into one of these functions. In the example below, the `WHERE text @0@ "night"` part of the query will match with `search::highlight("->", "<-", 0)` and `search::score(0) AS text_score`, while `title @1@ "hound"` will match with `search::score(1) AS title_score`.

```surql
DEFINE ANALYZER my_analyzer TOKENIZERS class, blank FILTERS lowercase, ascii;
DEFINE INDEX text_index ON TABLE article FIELDS text SEARCH ANALYZER my_analyzer BM25 HIGHLIGHTS;
DEFINE INDEX title_index ON TABLE article FIELDS title SEARCH ANALYZER my_analyzer BM25 HIGHLIGHTS;

INSERT INTO article (title, text) VALUES
    ("A Study in Scarlet", "IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army."),
    ("A Study in Scarlet", "Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon."),
    ("The Sign of the Four", "SHERLOCK HOLMES took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case."),
    ("The Hound of the Baskervilles", "MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table."),
    ("The Hound of the Baskervilles", "I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before.");

SELECT
    text,
    title,
    search::highlight("->", "<-", 0) AS title,
    search::score(0) AS text_score,
    search::score(1) AS title_score
FROM article
WHERE
    text  @0@ "night" OR
    title @1@ "hound";
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		text: 'MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table.',
		text_score: 0.30209195613861084f,
		title: 'MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all ->night<-, was seated at the breakfast table.',
		title_score: 0.32491400837898254f
	},
	{
		text: 'I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before.',
		text_score: 0.35619309544563293f,
		title: 'I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the ->night<- before.',
		title_score: 0.32491400837898254f
	}
]
```
