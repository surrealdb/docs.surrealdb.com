    LET $recents = 
        $sender->sends[WHERE out = $receiver]
        .filter(|$tx| time::now() - $tx.sent_at < 5m);
    IF $recents.len() > 2 {
        THROW "Can't send that many times within a short period of time";
    };
};
```

### Using Surrealist's graph visualization to see fraudulent activities

For more on these queries and their visual output, see [this dedicated blog post](/blog/fraud-detection-with-surrealdb).

Star pattern: one card used to pay large number of accounts:

```surql
DEFINE FIELD paid_at ON pays DEFAULT time::now();

-- sketchy cards
FOR $card IN CREATE |card:10| {
    FOR $_ IN 0..rand::int(5, 15) {
        LET $payee = UPSERT ONLY account;
        RELATE $card->pays->$payee SET amount = rand::int(100, 1000);    
    };
};

-- regular card
CREATE card:normal;
FOR $_ IN 0..rand::int(5, 15) {
    LET $payee = UPSERT ONLY account;
    RELATE card:normal->pays->$payee SET amount = rand::int(100, 1000), paid_at = time::now() - rand::duration(1d, 100d);
};

SELECT id, ->pays.filter(|$payment| time::now() - $payment.paid_at < 1d).out FROM card;
```

Tight communities that interact mostly among themselves:

```surql
-- Regular community of 200
CREATE |account:200|;
-- Smaller community that interacts among itself
CREATE |account:5| SET is_sketchy = true;

-- The sketchy community interacts only between itself
-- the regular community has more general interactions
-- and sometimes sends money to the sketchy accounts
FOR $account IN SELECT * FROM account {
    FOR $_ IN 0..10 {
        LET $counterpart = IF $account.is_sketchy {
            rand::enum(SELECT * FROM account WHERE is_sketchy)
        } ELSE {
            rand::enum(SELECT * FROM account)
        };
        RELATE $account->sends_to->$counterpart SET amount = rand::int(100, 1000);
    }
};

SELECT id, ->sends_to->account FROM account;
```

Circles showing loops of money returning to its origin:

```surql
CREATE |account:50|;
CREATE |account:1..15| SET is_sketchy = true;

FOR $sketchy IN SELECT * FROM account WHERE is_sketchy {
    LET $counterpart = rand::enum(SELECT * FROM account WHERE is_sketchy AND !<-sent);
    RELATE $sketchy->sent->$counterpart SET amount = rand::int(100, 1000);
};

LET $normal = SELECT * FROM account WHERE !is_sketchy;
FOR $account IN SELECT * FROM account WHERE !is_sketchy {
    LET $counterpart = rand::enum(SELECT * FROM $normal);
    RELATE $account->sent->$counterpart SET amount = rand::int(100, 1000);
};

SELECT id, ->sent->account FROM account;
```
