# Install on Windows

Use this tutorial to install SurrealDB on Windows operating systems using the SurrealDB [install script](/docs/surrealdb/installation/windows#installing-surrealdb-using-the-install-script), or using third-party package managers like [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or third-party like [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/). Both the SurrealDB Database Server and the SurrealDB Command Line Tool are packaged and distributed as a single executable file, which is easy to install, and easy to uninstall.

## Installing SurrealDB using the install script

To get started, you can use the SurrealDB [install script](https://github.com/surrealdb/install.surrealdb.com). This script securely downloads the latest version for the platform and CPU type. It installs SurrealDB into the `C:\Program Files\SurrealDB` folder, falling back to a user-specified folder if necessary.

```bash
iwr https://windows.surrealdb.com -useb | iex
```

### Updating SurrealDB

To ensure that you are using the latest version, update SurrealDB to version <Version /> using the following command.

```bash
iwr https://windows.surrealdb.com -useb | iex
```

### Checking SurrealDB

Once installed, you can run the SurrealDB command-line tool by using the `surreal` command. To check whether the installation was successful run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
surreal help
```

The result should look similar to the output below, confirming that the SurrealDB command-line tool was installed successfully.

```bash
.d8888b.                                             888 8888888b.  888888b.

## Troubleshooting

*Attempting to open the executable at the install location throws errors that the following DLLs are not installed*

If you encounter an error saying that the following DLLs are not installed:
* VCRUNTIME140.dll
* MSVCP140.dll
* VCRUNTIME140_1.dll

Then you may need to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version).
