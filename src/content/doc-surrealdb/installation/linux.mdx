# Install on Linux

Use this tutorial to install SurrealDB on Linux or Unix operating systems using the SurrealDB [install script](https://github.com/surrealdb/install.surrealdb.com). Both the SurrealDB Database Server and the SurrealDB Command Line Tool are packaged and distributed as a single executable file, which is easy to install, and easy to uninstall.

## Installing SurrealDB using the install script

To get started, you can use the SurrealDB [install script](https://github.com/surrealdb/install.surrealdb.com). This script securely downloads the latest version for the platform and CPU type. It attempts to install SurrealDB into the `/usr/local/bin` folder, falling back to a user-specified folder if necessary.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh
```

### Updating SurrealDB

To ensure that you are using the latest version, update SurrealDB to version <Version /> using the following command.

```bash
curl -sSf https://install.surrealdb.com | sh
```

### Checking SurrealDB

Once installed, you can run the SurrealDB command-line tool by using the `surreal` command. To check whether the install was successful run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
surreal help
```

The result should look similar to the output below, confirming that the SurrealDB command-line tool was installed successfully.

```bash
.d8888b.                                             888 8888888b.  888888b.
