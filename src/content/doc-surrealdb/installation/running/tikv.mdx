# Run a multi-node, scalable cluster

For highly-available and highly-scalable setups, SurrealDB can be run on top of a [TiKV](https://tikv.org/) cluster, with the ability to horizontally scale to 100+ terabytes of data. In this example, we will start a local TiKV cluster with a single node, for development and testing purposes only. To install TiKV on your development machine, run the following command. This will install the [`tiup`](https://github.com/pingcap/tiup) command-line tool, which enables deploying and managing TiKV clusters of any size.

```bash
curl -sSf https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/install.sh | sh
```

Once installed we shall start up a simple single-node development cluster.

```bash
tiup playground --tag surrealdb --mode tikv-slim --pd 1 --kv 1
```
Once TiKV is up and running, we can start a SurrealDB server instance, specifying the TiKV cluster endpoint as the backing data store.

```bash
surreal start tikv://127.0.0.1:2379
```
The default logging level for the database server is `info`, resulting in any informational logs to be output to the standard output. To control the logging verbosity, specify the *`--log`* argument. The following command starts the database with `debug` level logging, resulting in more logs being output to the terminal. If extra verbosity is not needed, specify a lower level or simply remove the flag, which will default to the `info` level.

```bash
surreal start --log debug tikv://127.0.0.1:2379
```
In order to keep SurrealDB secure, configure your initial root-level user by setting the *`--user`* and *`--pass`* command-line arguments. The following command starts the database with a top-level user named root with a password also set to `root`. The root user will be persisted in storage, which means you don't have to include the command line arguments next time you start SurrealDB.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root tikv://127.0.0.1:2379
```
In order to change the default port that SurrealDB uses for web connections and from database clients you can use the *`--bind`* argument. The following command starts the database on port `8080`.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 tikv://127.0.0.1:2379
```
After running the above command, you should see the SurrealDB server startup successfully.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 tikv://127.0.0.1:2379
