# Run a single-node, on-disk server

For the purposes of getting started with SurrealDB quickly, we will start a RocksDB database which persists data on the filesystem. This configuration is great for trying out the database and small deployments.

```bash 
surreal start rocksdb:mydatabase.db
```

The default logging level for the database server is `info`, resulting in any informational logs to be output to the standard output. To control the logging verbosity, specify the *`--log`* argument. The following command starts the database with `debug` level logging, resulting in more logs being output to the terminal. If extra verbosity is not needed, specify a lower level or simply remove the flag, which will default to the `info` level.

```bash
surreal start --log debug rocksdb:mydatabase.db
```

In versions of SurrealDB before 2.0.0, anyone would be able to connect to this server to begin running queries. However, SurrealDB since version 2.0.0 runs with authentication by default. In order to disable it, the `--unauthenticated` flag can be passed in.

```bash
surreal start --unauthenticated rocksdb:mydatabase.db
```

However, for anything but simple testing, it is better to configure your initial root-level user by setting the *`--user`* and *`--pass`* command-line arguments. The following command starts the database with a top-level user named root with a password also set to `root`. The root user will be persisted in storage, which means you don't have to include the command line arguments next time you start SurrealDB.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass secret rocksdb:mydatabase.db
```

In order to change the default port that SurrealDB uses for web connections and from database clients you can use the *`--bind`* argument. The following command starts the database on port `8080`.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass secret --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 rocksdb://path/to/mydatabase
```
After running the above command, you should see the SurrealDB server startup successfully.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass secret --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 rocksdb:mydatabase.db
