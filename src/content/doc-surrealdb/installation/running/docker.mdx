# Run with Docker

Use this tutorial to run SurrealDB from within Docker.

## Running the SurrealDB server using Docker

To get started using Docker, you can use the `latest` tag. To view all the available versions and tags, or to use a specific tag visit the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/surrealdb/surrealdb) page. To start a server use the [`start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) command. In Docker, SurrealDB listens on port `8000` in all interfaces by default so that the host can connect to the container in the default bridge networking mode.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For local development, use the `latest-dev` image variant (i.e., docker run --rm --pull always -p 8000:8000 surrealdb/surrealdb:latest-dev start). This version includes a shell and package manager, allowing you to install tools and interact with the container's internals.

In order to persist data when the Docker instance is restarted or shutdown, specify a Docker folder using the Docker *`-v`* command line argument, and use the on-disk storage engine in SurrealDB using the path prefix chosen as a Docker folder.

```bash
mkdir mydata # Create a directory to store the database, owned by the current user
docker run --rm --pull always -p 8000:8000 --user $(id -u) -v $(pwd)/mydata:/mydata surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start rocksdb:/mydata/mydatabase.db
```

The default logging level for the database server is `info`, resulting in any informational logs to be output to the standard output. To control the logging verbosity, specify the *`--log`* argument. The following command starts the database with `debug` level logging, resulting in more logs being output to the terminal. If extra verbosity is not needed, specify a lower level or simply remove the flag, which will default to the `info` level.

```bash
mkdir mydata # Create a directory to store the database, owned by the current user
docker run --rm --pull always -p 8000:8000 --user $(id -u) -v $(pwd)/mydata:/mydata surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --log debug rocksdb:/mydata/mydatabase.db
```

### Configuring authentication

Authentication is enabled by default since version `2.0`, using the `--unauthenticated` flag to opt out. In versions of SurrealDB before 2.0, authentication was disabled by default and required an `--auth` flag to enable.

To set up access as an authenticated user, configure your initial root-level user by setting the *`--user`* and *`--pass`* command-line arguments.

The following command starts the database with a top-level user named `root` with a password also set to `root`. The root user will be persisted in storage, which means you don't have to include the command line arguments next time you start SurrealDB.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 80:8000 -v /mydata:/mydata surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --user root --pass root rocksdb:mydatabase.db
```

In order to change the default port that SurrealDB uses for web connections and from database clients you can use the Docker *`-p`* command line argument to tunnel the port to the internal SurrealDB port which SurrealDB is served on. The following command starts the database on port `80`.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 80:8000 -v /mydata:/mydata surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --user root --pass root rocksdb:/mydata/mydatabase.db
```

After running the above command, you should see the SurrealDB server startup successfully.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always -p 80:8000 -v /local-dir:/container-dir surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start --user root --pass root rocksdb:/container-dir/mydatabase.db

```

For details on the [`start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) command, and all of the available configuration options and arguments, view the [`start command documentation`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start).

## Using the command-line tools within Docker
The Docker container contains both the server, and the command line tools for importing, exporting, and querying a remote SurrealDB server.

```bash
docker run --rm --pull always surrealdb/surrealdb:latest help
```

The result should look similar to the output below, confirming that the SurrealDB command-line tool was installed successfully.

```bash
.d8888b.                                             888 8888888b.  888888b.
