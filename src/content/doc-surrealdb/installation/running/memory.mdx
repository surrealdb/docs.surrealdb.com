# Run a single-node, in-memory server

For the purposes of getting started with SurrealDB quickly, we will start an in-memory database which does not persist data on shutdown. This database is great for development and testing.

```bash
surreal start memory
```

SurrealDB will assume `memory` in case this argument is not passed in, so the following command is identical to the above.

```bash
surreal start
```

The default logging level for the database server is `info`, resulting in any informational logs to be output to the standard output. To control the logging verbosity, specify the *`--log`* argument. The following command starts the database with `debug` level logging, resulting in more logs being output to the terminal. If extra verbosity is not needed, specify a lower level or simply remove the flag, which will default to the `info` level.

```bash
surreal start --log debug memory
```

In versions of SurrealDB before `2.0`, anyone would be able to connect to this server to begin running queries. However, SurrealDB since version `2.0` runs with authentication by default. In order to disable it, the `--unauthenticated` flag can be passed in.

```bash
surreal start --unauthenticated memory
```

However, for anything but simple testing, it is better to configure your initial root-level user by setting the *`--user`* and *`--pass`* command-line arguments. The following command starts the database with a top-level user named `root` with a password also set to `root`.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root memory
```

The previous command will bootstrap the server with the provided initial credentials, you can now remove those args and rely on [DEFINE USER](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/user) to change the password or create more users.

```bash
surreal start --user username --pass 123456 memory
```
In order to change the default port that SurrealDB uses for web connections and from database clients you can use the *`--bind`* argument. The following command starts the database on port `8080`.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 memory
```

After running the above command, you should see the SurrealDB server startup successfully.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 memory
