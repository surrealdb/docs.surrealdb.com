# Introduction

SurrealDB is a multi-model database built in Rust designed to unify multiple data models into a single, powerful engine. It combines document, graph, time-series, relational, geospatial and key-value data types with powerful search and retrieval (vector, full-text, hybrid), and real-time and event-driven capabilities, enabling developers to build powerful applications faster and more efficiently.

Common use cases include AI Agents, knowledge graphs, real-time apps (e.g. recommendation engines, fraud detection systems), and any other type of application requiring multiple data types. SurrealDB can also be used as a backend-as-a-service thanks to its support for direct user authentication. Given that it’s a single Rust binary, SurrealDB can run embedded (in‐app), in the browser (via WebAssembly), in the edge, as single backend node, or in a distributed cluster.

SurrealDB is open-source [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) and is also available as a cloud managed service through [SurrealDB Cloud](https://surrealdb.com/cloud).

**Overview & Differentiators**
- **Native Multi-Model:** combines document, graph, time-series, relational, geospatial and key-value data models natively into SurrealQL, without workarounds or added complexity.
- **AI Native Data Layer:** purpose-built for AI and context-aware applications with integrated search and retrieval (vector, full-text, hybrid) that blend semantic, graph, and relational intelligence.
- **Real-Time and Event-Driven:** built-in real-time subscriptions, event triggers, and streaming updates power reactive, real-time experiences - no need for Kafka, WebSockets, or extra layers.
- **Powerful Developer Experience:** SurrealQL is intuitive and combines the best ideas from SQL, NoSQL and graph within a single native syntax. Start schemaless and go schemafull.
- **Rust-Powered Performance:** high efficiency, memory safety, and compliance with government security standards with a single Rust binary.
- **Native ACID Compliance:** guarantees strong data consistency natively, without additional workarounds.
- **Deployment Flexibility:** single Rust binary and storage/compute separation allow SurrealDB to run embedded (in‐app), in the browser (via WebAssembly) or as a traditional back-end in a single node or in a highly-scalable distributed cluster.
- **Secure by Design:** built-in security with RBAC, record-level permissions, fine-grained access controls, JWT authentication, multi-tenant isolation and built-in compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001) keep data protected by default.

**Enterprise Case Studies**

Some of the largest enterprises in the world are using SurrealDB at scale in production:

- **Saks Fifth Avenue:** Uses SurrealDB for real-time product recommendations and AI-based personalized experiences.
- **Vodafone:** AI-powered assistant delivering real-time technical support to 10,000 field technicians.
- **Samsung Ads:** Utilizing SurrealDB for knowledge graphs in advertising analytics and AI-driven logistics optimization.
- **Tencent: Using SurrealDB for infrastructure monitoring, having consolidated 9 tools into one.**

**Key Use Cases**

SurrealDB is ideal for any application, in particular data intensive applications that require multiple data systems, such as:

- **AI Agents:** Building Generative AI systems leveraging a single unstructured and structured data layer with vector, graph and real-time capabilities for RAG, Graph RAG, and agent memory.
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Turning unstructured data into structured, queryable data with a flexible multi-model approach including support for graph relationships.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Such as fraud detection systems, recommendation engines and log analytics.
- **Embedded & Edge Computing:** SurrealDB is a single lightweight Rust binary and can be embedded in industrial environments, run in-memory or in browser.
- **Backend-as-a-Service:** With support for end-user authentication (if desired), SurrealDB can also be used as a BaaS for web applications.
