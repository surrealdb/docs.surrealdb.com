# Introduction

SurrealDB is a [multi-model database](/blog/what-are-multi-model-databases) built in Rust designed to unify multiple data models into a single, powerful engine. It combines [document](/docs/surrealdb/models/document), [graph](/docs/surrealdb/models/graph), [time-series](/docs/surrealdb/models/time-series), [relational](/docs/tutorials/define-a-schema), [geospatial](/docs/surrealdb/models/geospatial) and key-value data types into one query language, [SurrrealQL](/docs/surrealql), with powerful search and retrieval ([vector](/docs/surrealdb/models/vector), [full-text](/docs/surrealdb/models/full-text-search), hybrid), and https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/reference-guide/real-time-best-practices, enabling developers to build applications faster and more efficiently.

Common SurrealDB use cases include AI agents, knowledge graphs, real-time apps (e.g. recommendation engines, fraud detection systems), and any other type of application requiring multiple data types. SurrealDB can also be used as a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) thanks to its support for direct user authentication. Given that it’s a single Rust binary, SurrealDB can also run embedded (in‐app), in the browser (via WebAssembly), in the edge, as single backend node, or in a distributed cluster.

SurrealDB is open source (see the code [here on GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb)) and is also available as a cloud managed service through [SurrealDB Cloud](/cloud).

## Differentiators
- **Native multi-model:** combines document, graph, time-series, relational, geospatial and key-value data models natively into SurrealQL, without workarounds or added complexity.
- **AI native:** purpose-built for AI and context-aware applications with integrated search and retrieval (vector, full-text, hybrid) that blend semantic, graph, and relational intelligence.
- **Real-time and event-driven:** built-in real-time subscriptions, event triggers, and streaming updates power reactive, real-time experiences - no need for extra layers like [Kafka](https://github.com/surrealdb/surreal-sync/blob/main/docs/kafka.md).
- **Powerful developer experience:** SurrealQL is intuitive and combines the best ideas from SQL, NoSQL and graph within a single native syntax. Start schemaless and then make your schema as strictly defined as you like.
- **Rust-powered performance:** high efficiency, memory safety, type safety and concurrency with a single Rust binary.
- **Native ACID compliance:** guarantees immediate data consistency. Opt in to eventual consistency in certain cases if desired.
- **Deployment flexibility:** single Rust binary and storage/compute separation allow SurrealDB to run embedded (in‐app), in the browser (via WebAssembly) or as a traditional back-end in a single node or in a highly-scalable distributed cluster.
- **Secure by design:** built-in security with RBAC, record-level permissions, fine-grained access controls, JWT authentication, multi-tenant isolation and built-in compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001) keep data protected by default.

## Enterprise case studies 

SurrealDB is being used at scale in production by small and large organisations, such as:

- **Samsung Ads**, for knowledge graphs in advertising analytics.
- **SiteForge**, to reduce its development cycle, queries, and backend API usage.
- **Verizon**, for its generative AI assistant utilized by field technicians.
- **Tencent**, for infrastructure monitoring, having consolidated 9 tools into one.
- **PolyAI**, for low-latency, customer-controlled RAG across voice AI experiences.

More companies and an overview of the benefits provided by SurrealDB can be found in our [case studies page](/casestudies).

## Use cases 

SurrealDB is ideal for any application, in particular data intensive applications that require multiple data systems, such as:

- **AI agents:** building Generative AI systems leveraging a single unstructured and structured data layer with vector, graph and real-time capabilities for RAG, Graph RAG, and agent memory.
- **Knowledge graphs:** turning unstructured data into structured, queryable data with a flexible multi-model approach including support for graph relationships.
- **Real-time analytics:** fraud detection systems, recommendation engines and log analytics.
- **Embedded & edge computing:** SurrealDB is a single lightweight Rust binary and can be embedded in industrial environments, run in-memory or in browser.
- **Backend-as-a-Service:** with support for end-user authentication, SurrealDB can also be used as a BaaS for web applications, if desired.
