# Introduction

SurrealDB is a [multi-model database](/blog/what-are-multi-model-databases) built in Rust designed to unify multiple data models into a single, powerful engine. It combines [document](/docs/surrealdb/models/document), [graph](/docs/surrealdb/models/graph), [time-series](/docs/surrealdb/models/time-series), [relational](/docs/tutorials/define-a-schema), [geospatial](/docs/surrealdb/models/geospatial) and key-value data types into one query language, [SurrrealQL](/docs/surrealql), with powerful search and retrieval ([vector](/docs/surrealdb/models/vector), [full-text](/docs/surrealdb/models/full-text-search), hybrid), and real-time and event-driven capabilities, enabling developers to build applications faster and more efficiently.

Common SurrealDB use cases include AI agents, knowledge graphs, real-time apps (e.g. recommendation engines, fraud detection systems), and any other type of application requiring multiple data types. SurrealDB can also be used as a backend-as-a-service thanks to its support for direct user authentication. Given that it’s a single Rust binary, SurrealDB can also run embedded (in‐app), in the browser (via WebAssembly), in the edge, as single backend node, or in a distributed cluster.

SurrealDB is open-source (see our [GitHub](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) page) and is also available as a cloud managed service through [SurrealDB Cloud](/cloud).

## Differentiators
- **Native multi-model:** combines document, graph, time-series, relational, geospatial and key-value data models natively into SurrealQL, without workarounds or added complexity.
- **AI native data layer:** purpose-built for AI and context-aware applications with integrated search and retrieval (vector, full-text, hybrid) that blend semantic, graph, and relational intelligence.
- **Real-time and event-driven:** built-in real-time subscriptions, event triggers, and streaming updates power reactive, real-time experiences - no need for Kafka, WebSockets, or extra layers.
- **Powerful developer experience:** SurrealQL is intuitive and combines the best ideas from SQL, NoSQL and graph within a single native syntax. Start schemaless and go schemafull.
- **Rust-powered performance:** high efficiency, memory safety, and compliance with government security standards with a single Rust binary.
- **Native ACID compliance:** guarantees strong data consistency natively, without additional workarounds.
- **Deployment flexibility:** single Rust binary and storage/compute separation allow SurrealDB to run embedded (in‐app), in the browser (via WebAssembly) or as a traditional back-end in a single node or in a highly-scalable distributed cluster.
- **Secure by design:** built-in security with RBAC, record-level permissions, fine-grained access controls, JWT authentication, multi-tenant isolation and built-in compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001) keep data protected by default.

## Enterprise case studies 

SurrealDB is being used at scale in production by large organisations such as:

- **Saks Fifth Avenue:** uses SurrealDB for real-time product recommendations and AI-based personalized experiences.
- **Vodafone:** AI-powered assistant delivering real-time technical support to 10,000 field technicians.
- **Samsung Ads:** utilizing SurrealDB for knowledge graphs in advertising analytics.
- **Tencent** using SurrealDB for infrastructure monitoring, having consolidated 9 tools into one.

More information can be found in our [enterprise case studies page](/casestudies).

## Use cases 

SurrealDB is ideal for any application, in particular data intensive applications that require multiple data systems, such as:

- **AI agents:** building Generative AI systems leveraging a single unstructured and structured data layer with vector, graph and real-time capabilities for RAG, Graph RAG, and agent memory.
- **Knowledge graphs:** turning unstructured data into structured, queryable data with a flexible multi-model approach including support for graph relationships.
- **Real-time analytics:** such as fraud detection systems, recommendation engines and log analytics.
- **Embedded & edge computing:** SurrealDB is a single lightweight Rust binary and can be embedded in industrial environments, run in-memory or in browser.
- **Backend-as-a-Service:** with support for end-user authentication, SurrealDB can also be used as a BaaS for web applications, if desired.
