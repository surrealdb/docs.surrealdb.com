# Getting started

Welcome to SurrealDB! In this guide, you will learn about the various ways you can start using SurrealDB with interactive examples. Before we dive in, let's cover some basics.

## What is SurrealDB?

SurrealDB is a [multi-model](/blog/what-are-multi-model-databases) database that allows you to store data in a variety of ways.

When we say SurrealDB is a [multi-model](/blog/what-are-multi-model-databases) database, we mean that SurrealDB can store and query data using a variety of different paradigms. For example, you can use SurrealDB as a [Graph](/docs/surrealdb/models/graph), [Document](/docs/surrealdb/models/document), [Time-Series](/docs/surrealdb/models/time-series), or [Vector](/docs/surrealdb/models/vector) database, all designed to be queried with our [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql) query language. This allows you to design a database that fits the shape and requirements of your data.

In addition to giving you complete flexibility over your data model, SurrealDB can also be integrated in a variety of ways. You can use SurrealDB as a traditional backend database, connect to it directly as a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service), embed it directly into your applications, and much more!

The advantage of using SurrealDB lies in its ability to adapt to your needs, rather than forcing you to adopt a rigid data structure or spreading your data across different databases, which can lead to data inconsistency and duplication.

## Running queries in SurrealDB

Much like any other database, you can communicate with SurrealDB by executing queries.

Queries are written using [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql), SurrealDB's powerful and flexible query language. While SurrealQL takes inspiration from traditional SQL, it is designed to be more expressive and flexible, allowing you to query your data in a variety of ways.

Let's take a look at some of the basic queries you can run in SurrealDB.

{/* There are two main ways to use SurrealQL:

1. **Surrealist**: A graphical user interface (GUI) that can be accessed via a web browser or used as a desktop application.
2. **SurrealDB CLI**: A command-line interface that allows you to interact with SurrealQL directly from the terminal.

For more information, you can visit [Surrealist](https://Surrealist.app) and the [SurrealDB CLI documentation](/docs/surrealdb/cli/). */}

{/* <Tabs groupId="running-surrealql">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="Using Surrealist" default>

Once you have your database running, head over to [Surrealist](https://Surrealist.app). Surrealist offers a simple interface to run SurrealQL queries. You can run queries, view the results, and even save your queries for later use. To start running queries, you can either [set up a connection using your database credentials](/docs/surrealist/getting-started#creating-a-connection) or [use a sandbox](/docs/surrealist/getting-started#using-the-sandbox) which uses the default credentials.

For the sake of this guide, we recommend using a sandbox connection. Once you have set up your connection, you can run your queries in the query editor.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CLI" label="Using CLI">
Once you have your [database running](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start), you can use the [SurrealDB CLI](/docs/surrealdb/cli/) to run your queries. To do so, run the following commands:

1. Running without relying on an external server

```bash
surreal sql --endpoint memory --ns namespace --db database --pretty
```

2. Running with a specific endpoint, username, and password, and namespace, and database, run the following command:

```bash
surreal sql --endpoint http://localhost:8000 --username root --password root --namespace test --database test
```


> [!NOTE]
> The `--endpoint` flag is the URL of your SurrealDB instance. The `--username` and `--password` flags are the credentials you set when you started the database. The `--namespace` and `--database` flags are the namespace and database you want to connect to. The values above can be set to your preference. Learn more about this in the [Start command](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) documentation.


Once you see the `>`character you can type your SurrealQL query, followed by the enter key. The command has support for `↑` and `↓` arrows for selecting previous SurrealQL statements, and stores the statement history in a history.txt file. To exit the REPL use the `ctrl + c` or `ctrl + d` key combinations.
</TabItem>
</Tabs> */}




{/* ## Start the database

First ensure that your database is set up correctly. To do so, run:

```bash
surreal version
```
To start your database, run the start command specific to your machine.

### macOS or Linux

```bash
surreal start memory -A --user root --pass root
```
### Windows

```shell
surreal.exe start memory -A --user root --pass root
```

Here's what each segment of this command does:

- `surreal start`: This initiates the process of starting the SurrealDB database server.
- `-A`: Enable all capabilities.
- `--user root --pass root`: These flags set the initial username and password to access the database. Here both are set as root. Once the initial credentials are created, they are persisted in the datastore, which means you don't have to include the command line arguments next time you start SurrealDB. Instead, they should be securely stored in [environment variables](/docs/surrealdb/cli/env) or some form of secret management system.
- `memory`: This argument indicates that the database should be run in memory. Databases run in memory can have quicker data access times because they're not reading and writing from disk, but the data will be lost when the server is restarted. 
*/}

### Creating data with CREATE

Before we can start querying data, we need to create some records. This can be done using the [CREATE statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/create), which is used to add new records to the database.

The following example demonstrates how to create a record in the `category` table, initialized with a `name` field and a `created_at` field. Press the *"Run query"* button to execute the query and view the response.

<br /> 

<SurrealistMini
	resultMode="single"
	query={`
		CREATE category SET
			name = 'Technology',
			created_at = time::now();
	`}
/>

After executing this statement, the `category` record is created in the database, and a randomly generated unique id known as a [Record ID](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/ids) is assigned to it. This ID represents the primary key of our record, and can be used to reference the record in future queries.

When creating records, you can also explicitly set the record ID. This can be useful when you want to reference a specific record in your queries. In the following example, we create a person record with the ID `john`, and set the `name`, `age`, `admin`, and `signup_at` fields.

<br />

<SurrealistMini
	resultMode="single"
	query={`
		CREATE person:john SET
			name.first = 'John',
			name.last = 'Adams',
			name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last),
			age = 29,
			admin = true,
			signup_at = time::now();
	`}
/>

One of the many powerful features of SurrealDB is the ability to write subqueries, which in the following example is used to populate the `category` field of the `article` record with the ID of the `Technology` category.

<br />

<SurrealistMini
	resultMode="single"
	setup={`
		CREATE category SET name = 'Technology', created_at = time::now();
		CREATE person:john SET
			name.first = 'John',
			name.last = 'Adams',
			name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last),
			age = 29,
			admin = true,
			signup_at = time::now();
	`}
	query={`
		CREATE article SET
			created_at = time::now(),
			author = person:john,
			title = 'Lorem ipsum dolor',
			text = 'Donec eleifend, nunc vitae commodo accumsan, mauris est fringilla.',
			category = (SELECT VALUE id FROM ONLY category WHERE name = 'Technology' LIMIT 1);
	`}
/>

### Querying data with SELECT

After inserting records into your database, you can now use the [SELECT statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/select) to retrieve data. This statement will be familiar to anyone who has used traditional SQL before, however SurrealDB's SELECT statement includes additional powerful features inspired by NoSQL databases.

For example, in addition to selecting records from a single table, you can also select records from multiple tables, or select specific records by their Record ID.

<br />

<SurrealistMini
	setup={`
		CREATE category SET name = 'Technology', created_at = time::now();
		CREATE person:john SET
			name.first = 'John',
			name.last = 'Adams',
			name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last),
			age = 29,
			admin = true,
			signup_at = time::now();
		CREATE article SET
			created_at = time::now(),
			author = person:john,
			title = 'Lorem ipsum dolor',
			text = 'Donec eleifend, nunc vitae commodo accumsan, mauris est fringilla.',
			category = (SELECT VALUE id FROM ONLY category WHERE name = 'Technology' LIMIT 1);
	`}
	query={`
		-- Select all records from a table
		SELECT * FROM article;

		-- Select records from multiple tables
		SELECT * FROM category, person;

		-- Selecting specific records
		SELECT * FROM person:john;
	`}
/>

The [SELECT statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/select) offers a variety of different features, such as the ability to filter on fields, fetch and resolve record id contents, and the ability to access data directly from Record IDs without the need of JOINs or complex queries.

The following query combines multiple of such features:
- **Filtering**: We use the `WHERE` clause to only include records where the author's age is less than 30.
- **Fetching**: We can use the `FETCH` clause to replace record ids with their actual record values.
- **Specific fields**: We only want to retrieve the title and author fields from the article table.
- **Record links**: We use `author.name.full` to directly access the full name of the author.

<SurrealistMini
	resultMode="single"
	setup={`
		CREATE category SET name = 'Technology', created_at = time::now();
		CREATE person:john SET
			name.first = 'John',
			name.last = 'Adams',
			name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last),
			age = 29,
			admin = true,
			signup_at = time::now();
		CREATE article SET
			created_at = time::now(),
			author = person:john,
			title = 'Lorem ipsum dolor',
			text = 'Donec eleifend, nunc vitae commodo accumsan, mauris est fringilla.',
			category = (SELECT VALUE id FROM ONLY category WHERE name = 'Technology' LIMIT 1);
	`}
	query={`
		SELECT title, category, author.name.full AS author_name FROM article
		WHERE author.age < 30
		FETCH author, category;
	`}
/>

### Modifying data with UPDATE

{/* Similar to other databases, SurrealDB allows you to update records using the [`UPDATE` statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/update). You can also update specific IDs, for example say you wanted to update the first name of a specific person you can simply run: */}

Records can be updated using the [UPDATE](/docs/surrealql/statements/update) statement, which allows you to modify the contents of existing records.

Much like the `SELECT` statement, you can pass both table names and individual record IDs to the `UPDATE` statement. This allows you to update specific records, or update multiple records at once.

<SurrealistMini
	resultMode="single"
	setup={`
		CREATE category SET name = 'Technology', created_at = time::now();
		CREATE person:john SET
			name.first = 'John',
			name.last = 'Adams',
			name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last),
			age = 29,
			admin = true,
			signup_at = time::now();
		CREATE article SET
			created_at = time::now(),
			author = person:john,
			title = 'Lorem ipsum dolor',
			text = 'Donec eleifend, nunc vitae commodo accumsan, mauris est fringilla.',
			category = (SELECT VALUE id FROM ONLY category WHERE name = 'Technology' LIMIT 1);
	`}
	query={`
		UPDATE person:john SET
			name.first = 'David',
			name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last);
	`}
/>

The `UPDATE` statement offers a variety of features to further filter down records, and apply different update strategies. The following example demonstrates how we can merge new data into records matching a specific condition.

<br />

<SurrealistMini
	resultMode="single"
	setup={`
		CREATE category SET name = 'Technology', created_at = time::now();
		CREATE person:john SET
			name.first = 'David',
			name.last = 'Adams',
			name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last),
			age = 29,
			admin = true,
			signup_at = time::now();
		CREATE article SET
			created_at = time::now(),
			author = person:john,
			title = 'Lorem ipsum dolor',
			text = 'Donec eleifend, nunc vitae commodo accumsan, mauris est fringilla.',
			category = (SELECT VALUE id FROM ONLY category WHERE name = 'Technology' LIMIT 1);
	`}
	query={`
		UPDATE person MERGE {
			age: 30,
			admin: false
		}
	`}
/>

In addition to the `UPDATE` statement, SurrealDB also offers an [UPSERT statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/upsert), which has the added functionality of creating a record if it does not already exist. This can be useful when you want to update a record if it exists, or create it if it does not.

### Deleting data with DELETE

Finally, you can delete records from your database using the [DELETE statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/delete). This statement allows you to remove records from your database, either by specifying the record ID, or by using specific conditions.

The following example demonstrates the use of the `RETURN` clause, which instructs SurrealDB to return the records before they are deleted.

<br />

<SurrealistMini
	resultMode="single"
	setup={`
		CREATE category SET name = 'Technology', created_at = time::now();
		CREATE person:john SET
			name.first = 'David',
			name.last = 'Adams',
			name.full = string::join(' ', name.first, name.last),
			age = 29,
			admin = true,
			signup_at = time::now();
		CREATE article SET
			created_at = time::now(),
			author = person:john,
			title = 'Lorem ipsum dolor',
			text = 'Donec eleifend, nunc vitae commodo accumsan, mauris est fringilla.',
			category = (SELECT VALUE id FROM ONLY category WHERE name = 'Technology' LIMIT 1);
	`}
	query={`
		DELETE article WHERE author.name.first = 'David' RETURN BEFORE;
	`}
/>

### Getting started by installing SurrealDB

One of the most popular ways to get started with SurrealDB is to install and run it as a standalone database service, allowing any number of clients to connect to it and interact with the data.
When starting SurrealDB through the command line, you can fully customize the database to your needs.

<a
	href="/docs/surrealdb/installation"
	class="gradient-button mt-2 mb-6"
>
	Install SurrealDB
	<Icon name="fa6-solid:download" class="w-4" />
</a>

After you have installed SurrealDB, you can start the database using the [`surreal start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) command provided by the [SurrealDB CLI](/docs/surrealdb/cli).

When you start the database, you must specify which storage engine to use. This can be done by providing the engine as as the connection URL protocol. The following examples demonstrate how to start SurrealDB using different storage engines.
