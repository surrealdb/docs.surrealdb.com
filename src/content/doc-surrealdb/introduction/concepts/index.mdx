# Concepts

This page aims to give details about some of the core concepts of SurrealDB, including the intended usecases, design choices, and overarching features.

## Traditional database or backend layer
SurrealDB can be used either as a traditional database platform, with backend languages and frameworks including Golang, Python, Rust, C, Java, .NET, Node.js, and PHP. Alternatively, you can use SurrealDB as a complete backend platform, connecting directly to it from frontend languages and frameworks including JavaScript, [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), [React.js](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/). In this mode, permissions can be defined on a table, record, and field level, allow for granular data access patterns for multiple different types of users.

## Relational, document, or graph
SurrealDB is, at its core, a document database. Each record is stored on an underlying key-value store storage engine, with the ability to store arbitrary arrays, objects, and many other types of data. However, SurrealDB isn't just a document database. Because of the way that SurrealDB handles Record IDs and the fetching of individual records from the underlying key-value storage engine, it can be used to store time-series ordered data, and highly-connected graph data. With the addition of an SQL-like query language (named [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql)), it is easy to create, update, and read data from across the database.

## Single-node or distributed
SurrealDB is designed to be run in many different ways, and environments. Due to the [separation of the storage and compute layers](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture), SurrealDB can be run in embedded mode, as a vertically-scalable, single-node database server, or as a horizontally-scalable, multi-node, distributed cluster. In embedded mode, SurrealDB can be run with an in-memory storage engine, in a web browser it can persist data using [IndexedDB](https://web.dev/indexeddb/), or it can persist data using the file-based [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) storage engine. As a database server, SurrealDB can currently be configured to store data using [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/), [TiKV](https://tikv.org/), or [FoundationDB](https://www.foundationdb.org/).

## System structure
SurrealDB works similarly to other traditional relational databases, and document databases, with a few slight differences. SurrealDB is designed and developed to be a multi-tenant database platform with a high-level [`namespace`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/namespace) layer designed as a separation for each organisations, department, or development team. There is no limit to the number of namespaces on SurrealDB. Below this, the [`databases`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/database) layer is similar to databases in other database management systems. There is no limit to the number of databases on each namespace. Within each database, data can be stored within [`table`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/table) definitions, otherwise known as collections in other database management systems. In SurrealDB each row or document is called a [`record`](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/ids) and columns are called [`fields`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/field). While you can [`define`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define):

- [`namespace`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/namespace)
- [`databases`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/database)
- [`table`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/table)
- [`fields`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/field)

You cannot define [`records`](/docs/surrealql/datamodel/ids), you can only [create](/docs/surrealql/statements/create), read, [update](/docs/surrealql/statements/update) and [delete](/docs/surrealql/statements/delete) them.

Multiple [access](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access) methods can be defined on `namespace` and `database`. The [record](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/access/record) access method allows for custom authentication across tables, records, and fields.
