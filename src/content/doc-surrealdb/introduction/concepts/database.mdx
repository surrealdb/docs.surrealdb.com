# Database

A database within SurrealDB is contained within a [namespace](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/concepts/namespace) and is the primary unit where data is stored. Databases hold the actual data tables, indexes, and other data structures. Each database can have its own schema, settings, and permissions. The database is where you perform most of the data operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, queries, and transactions.

## Database structure

Databases are defined using the [`DEFINE DATABASE`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/database) statement in SurrealQL. The statement requires a unique name for the database and can optionally include a comment for additional context. The following is the syntax for defining a database:

```syntax title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE DATABASE [ OVERWRITE | IF NOT EXISTS ] @name [ STRICT ] [ COMMENT @string ]
```

You can also view the list of databases in your SurrealDB instance using the [`INFO`](/docs/surrealql/statements/info) statement. This statement provides information about the accesses, analyzers, functions, params, tables and users present in the current database instance.

```surql
{
	analyzers: {},
	functions: {},
	models: {},
	params: {},
	scopes: {},
	tables: {},
	tokens: {},
	users: {}
}
```

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a root, namespace, or database user before you can use the `DEFINE DATABASE` statement.

## The `STRICT` clause

<Since v="v3.0.0-beta.1" />

A database can be defined as `STRICT`. While a database by default will execute a [`DEFINE TABLE`](/docs/surrealql/statements/define/table) statement when a user attempts to create a record for an as-yet undefined table, a strict database will return an error until the user specifically defines the table.

```surql
-- Works by default if `STRICT` not used
CREATE person; 

-- Define and switch to strict database
DEFINE DATABASE strict_db STRICT;
USE DATABASE strict_db;

-- Now does not work by default
CREATE person;
-- "Thrown error: The table 'person' does not exist"

-- Now user must define the table first for `CREATE` to work
DEFINE TABLE person;
CREATE person;
```
