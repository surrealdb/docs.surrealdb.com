# Known Issues

Here are some known bugs and issues with SurrealDB.

## SDKs

### `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` are not yet available in the `DEFINE` statement

- **Date added:** 2024-05-21
- **Affected versions:** 1.x
- **Fixed versions:** -

Some query functionality is not yet available in the SDKs. Such as `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses in the [`DEFINE` statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/define). This means that if you used these clauses in your query method (as seen in the example below), the SDK would not be able to parse the query correctly.

```js
await db.query(
    'DEFINE FIELD IF NOT EXISTS email ON TABLE user TYPE string;'
);
```

When using a pre-2.0 version of the Rust SDK, the [`sql2` feature flag](https://docs.rs/crate/surrealdb/1.5.5/features) can be enabled to allow it to recognize newer syntax.

## SurrealQL

### `DELETE ONLY` always returns an error

- **Date added:** 2024-05-21
- **Issue number:** [#3936](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/3936)
- **Affected versions:** 1.x
- **Fixed versions:** -

In the [`DELETE` statement](/docs/surrealql/statements/delete) the `ONLY` clause doesn't work as expected because it checks for a length of 1 and `DELETE` doesn't return anything by default at this time. So it always gives the following error:

- 'Expected a single result output when using the ONLY keyword'. 

However, adding `RETURN $before` will force `DELETE` to return the deleted record, which will be the expected length of 1.

```surql
CREATE person:one;

// Currently fails
DELETE ONLY person:one;

// Workaround: add RETURN $before
DELETE ONLY person:one RETURN $before;
