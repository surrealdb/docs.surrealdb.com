# `signup`

<br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unlike v1, v2 returns an object containing an optional `token` property and an optional `refresh` property.

Currently, the functionality of this method is identical to v1, except for the structure of the returned object as noted above. Have a look at the [v1 documentation](/docs/surrealdb/integration/rpc/v1#signup).
