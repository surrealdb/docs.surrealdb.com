# RPC Protocol

The RPC protocol allows for network-protocol agnostic communication with SurrealDB. It is used internally by our client SDKs, and supports both HTTP and WebSocket based communication. Combined with the power of our [CBOR protocol](./cbor) specification, the RPC protocol provides a fully type-safe and efficient way to interact with SurrealDB over the network. We introduced [RPC v2 protocol](./rpc/v2) with SurrealDB 2.0 to allow for breaking changes, with the goal of implementing those changes in the SDKs.
