# Embedding in Python

SurrealDB is designed to be run in many different ways, and environments. Due to the [separation of the storage and compute](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture) layers, SurrealDB can be run in embedded mode, from within a number of different language environments. 

In Python, SurrealDB can be run as an in-memory database, or it can persist data using a file-based storage engine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The current version of the SurrealDB Python SDK does not support embedding. In the meantime, please refer to the [Python client SDK](/docs/sdk/python) documentation to get started with connecting to SurrealDB from Python.
