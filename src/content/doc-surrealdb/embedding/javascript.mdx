# Embedding in Javascript

SurrealDB is designed to be run in many different ways, and environments. Due to the [separation of the storage and compute](/docs/surrealdb/introduction/architecture) layers, SurrealDB can be run in embedded mode, from within your JavaScript environments. 

You can embed SurrealDB in both browser and server environments. In browser environments using the [Wasm engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/wasm), SurrealDB can be run as an in-memory database, or it can persist data using IndexedDB. In server environments using the [Node.js engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/node), SurrealDB can be run as an embedded database, backed by either an in-memory engine or [SurrealKV](/docs/surrealkv).

In this document, we will cover how to embed SurrealDB in both browser and server environments.

## Browser
In browser environments, using the [Wasm engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/wasm), you can run SurrealDB in-memory or with IndexedDB persistence.

For more information on how to embed SurrealDB in browser environments, please see the [Wasm engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/wasm) documentation.

## Server

In server environments, you can use the [Node.js engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/node) to run SurrealDB as an embedded database. 

For more information on how to embed SurrealDB in server environments, please see the [Node.js engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/node) documentation.
