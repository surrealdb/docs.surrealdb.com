# Further Surrealism examples

More examples of Surrealism in practice can be seen inside the [surrealism repo](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/tree/main/surrealism). They include a more comprehensive demo of the Rust code, 

## Surrealism Rust code demo

[This demo](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/tree/main/surrealism/demo) contains more examples of functions and the `#[surrealism]` attribute. For example, it can be used to rename the file on the SurrealDB side:

```rust
#[surrealism(name = "other")]
fn can_drive_bla(age: i64) -> bool {
	age >= 18
}
```

It can be used to make a function the default, allowing it to be called via the module path alone:

```rust
#[surrealism(default)]
fn def(age: i64) -> bool {
	age >= 18
}
```

## CLI examples

[This file](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/blob/main/crates/surrealism/test/test.sh) shows further usage of how the Surrealism CLI can be used to work with Surrealism functions directly as opposed to through a SurrealDB instance.

```bash
# See function signature
surreal module sig can_drive demo.surli

# Run function with argument 
surreal module run can_drive --arg 17 demo.surli
```

## Build scripts

[This folder](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/tree/main/surrealism/test) contains build scripts for the Surrealism CLI and test examples. Cloning the repo and running `full.sh` is enough to build the CLI and run all the test examples.
