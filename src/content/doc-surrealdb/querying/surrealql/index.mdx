# SurrealQL

In this section, you will explore [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql), a powerful database query language that closely resembles traditional SQL but comes with unique differences and improvements.

[SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql) is designed to provide developers with a seamless and intuitive way to interact with SurrealDB. It offers a familiar syntax and supports various statement types, allowing you to perform complex database operations efficiently.

While SurrealQL shares similarities with traditional SQL, it introduces enhancements and optimizations that make it well-suited for working with SurrealDB's advanced features. Whether you are querying data, modifying records, or managing database structures, SurrealQL provides a comprehensive set of capabilities to meet your needs.


## Getting Started

To start using SurrealQL, [refer to the documentation on the various statement types and their syntax](/docs/surrealql/statements). The statements page provides comprehensive examples and explanations for each statement type, helping you understand how to construct queries and interact with SurrealDB effectively.

We hope that SurrealQL empowers you to leverage the full potential of SurrealDB and enables you to build robust and scalable applications. Let's dive into the world of SurrealQL and unlock the capabilities of SurrealDB together!
