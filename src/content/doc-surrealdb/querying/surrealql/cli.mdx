# SurrealQL via CLI

In this section, you will explore writing [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql) queries using the SurrealDB CLI. To get started, you will need to install the SurrealDB CLI on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions in the [installation section](/docs/surrealdb/cli).

The CLI provides allows you to write, execute, and visualize [SurrealQL](/docs/surrealql) queries in real-time.

## Getting Started

After installing the SurrealDB CLI, you can start writing SurrealQL queries by running the [`surreal start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) command in your terminal. You can also add the `--help` flag to view the available options and commands.

To start a SurrealDB server, run the surreal start command, using the options below. This example serves the database at the default location (http://localhost:8000), with a username and password.

```bash
surreal start --endpoint http://localhost:8000 --user root --pass root
```

The server is actively running, and should be left alone until you want to stop hosting the SurrealDB server.

## Running Queries

To run a SurrealQL query, In the new terminal, run the [`surreal sql`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) command followed by the query you would like to execute. For example, to run a simple `SELECT` query, you can run the following command:

```bash title="Start a SurrealDB Shell with local endpoint"
surreal sql --endpoint http://localhost:8000 --ns test --db test
```

```bash title="Start a SurrealDB Shell with memory endpoint"
## Run query in memory
surreal sql --endpoint memory --ns test --db test
```
