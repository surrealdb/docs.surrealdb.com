# Engines 

The SurrealDB JavaScript SDK supports two engines for running in embedded mode. 

- [Node.js](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/node) : Run SurrealDB as an embedded database within a server-side environment, backed by either an in-memory engine or SurrealKV.

- [WebAssembly](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/wasm) : Run SurrealDB as an embedded database within a browser environment it enables SurrealDB to be run in-memory, or to persist data by running on top of IndexedDB. 

Learn more about the [Node.js engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/node) and the [WebAssembly engine](/docs/sdk/javascript/engines/wasm) in the following sections.
