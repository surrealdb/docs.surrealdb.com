# SurrealKV

SurrealKV is an embedded ACID-compliant key-value storage engine with built-in versioning, that allows for historical or temporal querying. It is built entirely in Rust - like the rest of SurrealDB.

Since SurrealKV supports historical/temporal querying, you can user the [VERSION](/docs/surrealql/statements/select#the-version-clause) clause when selecting or creating data to access historical data. Learn more in the SurrealQL documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although included in SurrealDB `2.0`, the storage engine itself is considered beta, and may require additional development and testing before it is ready for production use.


## Key Features

SurrealKV offers several key features that makes it a powerful and versatile database storage engine:

- **Embedded Database**: SurrealKV is available for embedded environments.

- **Built-in Versioning**: Track and access historical versions of your data.

- **Compaction**: Efficient storage management through compaction.

- **Durability Guaranteed**: Persistent storage with protection against system failures.

## When do I use SurrealKV?

While SurrealKV is particularly well-suited for certain use cases, it can differ in terms of performance and limitations from RocksDB. The next article will list the benefits and limitations of SurrealKV.
