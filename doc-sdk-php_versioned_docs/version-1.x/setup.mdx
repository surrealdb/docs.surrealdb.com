# Getting Started

Before you can use this SDK in PHP, you need to install the SDK via the Composer package manager.
This guide will walk you through the process of installing the SDK into your project.

### Install the SDK

Within your Compose project, run the following command to install the SDK:

```bash
composer add surrealdb.php [version]
```

<span>The latest version of the PHP SDK is <Version /></span>

### Using the SDK

Once you have installed the SDK, make sure to include the [Composer autoloader](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) in your PHP script:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

You can now use the SDK in your PHP script by importing it:

```php
use Surreal\Surreal;
```
