# `DEFINE ACCESS ... TYPE RECORD`

A record access method allows accessing SurrealDB as a [record user](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/security/authentication#record-users).

Record users allow SurrealDB to operate as a web database by offering mechanisms to define custom signin and signup logic as well as custom table and field permissions.

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated as a [root, namespace or database user](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/define/user) before you can define a record access method.
- [You must select your namespace and database](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/use) before you can define a record access method.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE ACCESS [ IF NOT EXISTS ] @name
  ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
    [ SIGNUP @expression ]
    [ SIGNIN @expression ]
    [ AUTHENTICATE @expression ]
    [ WITH JWT
      [ ALGORITHM @algorithm KEY @key | URL @url ]
      [ WITH ISSUER KEY @key ]
    ]
  [ DURATION
    [ FOR TOKEN @duration ]
    [ FOR SESSION @duration ]
  ]
```

## Example usage

Below shows how you can define record access using the `DEFINE ACCESS ... TYPE RECORD` statement.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS account ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
	SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass) )
	SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
	DURATION FOR TOKEN 15m, FOR SESSION 12h
;
```

### With JSON Web Token

Successful authentication with a record access method results in SurrealDB generating a JSON Web Token (JWT or, in the context of SurrealDB, just "token") that can be used until its expiration to authenticate as the record user without the need of providing any additional credentials. These tokens can also be issued by third parties and trusted by SurrealDB in order to allow for the authentication process to take place outside of SurrealDB, while the resulting access claims can be provided to SurrealDB inside of a token that it can trust. This feature is provided by the `WITH JWT` clause, which behaves similarly to [the JWT access method](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/define/access/jwt).

Since the origin of the claims in the JWT is verified, those claims can be used within SurrealQL in order to provide table and field authorization through an external authenticator using OpenID Connect, OAuth or simply acting as a trusted issuer of a JWT. This can be done by leveraging table permissions to allow or disallow access depending on the values of the claims in the verified token. For example, these claims can be compared with the records in a table to only return those matching certain criteria.

Bear in mind that table and field permissions only apply to [record users](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/security/authentication#record-users), which must use tokens that are verified by a `RECORD` access method. Access provided by namespace and database tokens defined in a `JWT` access method is equivalent to access from [system users](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/security/authentication#system-users), which is above fine-grained permissions. When application users will be the ones directly authenticating with JWT, defining a `RECORD` access method `WITH JWT` is most likely the right choice.

The following example shows how record access with a token can be used to grant authorization either by verifying that the `id` claim in the token (which is used to populate the [`$auth`](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/parameters#auth) reserved parameter) matches the record that is being queried from the `user` table or if the `privileged` claim is set to `true` in the token:

```surql
-- Specify the namespace and database for the token
USE NS abcum DB app_vitalsense;

DEFINE ACCESS token_name ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD WITH JWT

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----";

DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL
  -- Authorized users can select, update, delete and create user records
  PERMISSIONS FOR select, update, delete, create
  -- The access method must be "users"
  WHERE $access = "users"
  -- The record of the user being queried must match the one identified in the token
  -- Only matching records will be changed or returned
  AND id = $auth.id
  -- Allow privileged tokens to query any user
  OR $token.privileged = true
;
```

You may also use permissions clauses to perform additional verification on other JWT claims that may be required or recommended by the provider of the token, such as verifying that the `iss` claim matches a specific principal using `$token.iss`. However, this kind of logic may be better suited for the [`AUTHENTICATE`](#with-authenticate-clause) clause, which is only executed when the token is validated before an authenticated session is established instead of in every query and for each record.

The token payload should at least include the following claims when used to authenticate as a record user in SurrealDB.

```json title="JWT Payload"
{
  "exp": 2147483647,
  "ns": "abcum",
  "db": "app_vitalsense",
  "ac": "users",
  "id": "user:1"
}
```

When the `id` claim is present in the token, the fields of the record matching the identifier specified will be accessible through the `$auth` reserved parameter. For example, if the value of the `id` claim is `user:73q1bl039y6k8z80v55d`, and user records have fields such as “name” or “email”, then `$auth.name` and `$auth.email` can be used to access those values for the `user:73q1bl039y6k8z80v55d` record specifically, without them being present in the JWT.

#### With Issuer

When explicitly defining a way to verify tokens for record access, it is also possible to customize how these tokens are issued by SurrealDB. This allows specifying the algorithm and the signing key, which otherwise default to the HS512 algorithm with a randomly generated 128-character alphanumeric key. Configuring a record access method to sign tokens with specific signing credentials allows third party services to trust tokens issued by SurrealDB by trusting those signing credentials. In this way, an external service may rely on the signup and signin logic that has been implemented for record users in SurrealDB for its own authentication.

Currently, the algorithm for the issuer and the verifyier are required to match. For this reason, the issuer algorithm can be omitted if it has already been defined in the `WITH JWT` clause. Likewise, an issuer does not need to be explicitly defined in the case where a key to verify JWT using a symmetric algorithm has already been defined in the `WITH JWT` clause, as the same key will also be used to sign the tokens.

The following is an example of defining a record access method that can issue tokens with an asymmetric key pair:

```surql

```

The issuer is implicitly defined when using a symmetric algorithm in `WITH JWT`:

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS token_name ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD WITH JWT
-- Symmetric algorithm with a symmetric key
-- The same key is used to sign and verify
ALGORITHM HS512 KEY "secret";
-- The following clause is implicit:
-- WITH ISSUER ALGORITHM HS512 KEY "secret"
```

### With `AUTHENTICATE` clause

The authenticate clause can be used to change the record identifier returned by the `SIGNIN` and `SIGNUP` clauses or replace the identifier provided in the token when authenticating `WITH JWT`. This clause can also be used to log or stop authentication attempts from record users, as it is always executed across signin, signup and token authentication. The clause always expects a record identifier to be returned and will otherwise fail.

Unlike the [`PERMISSIONS`](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/define/table#defining-permissions) clause, the `AUTHENTICATE` clause is executed only at the time of authentication, resulting in increased performance for queries that only need to be validated at that point. On the other hand, permissions queries are executed in every query and for each record, ensuring that any authorization conditions are verified at the time of the query. The `AUTHENTICATE` clause is a good fit for validating specific conditions that are not expected to change during the lifetime of the session such as the presence of any required token claims.

#### Example: External authentication providers

Replacing the record identifier that will be used to establish the session is especially useful in scenarios where the token used to authenticate the session does not contain one. This is common when using an external authentication provider, which may only have knowledge of generic user identifiers such as an email address or UUID.

In the below example, we check if the session may already be tied to an existing user by using the `$auth` reserved parameter, which contains the record identifier of the authenticated user. If we can select the `id` field from `$auth`, it means that the token already contained the `id` for a record that exists in the database. If that is not the case, we can check if the token contains a different claim that we can rely on to uniquely identifies users. In this case we check for an email address. If the `email` claim is present in the token, we try to retrieve the user from the `user` table by their email address. If none of the queries return a record, the `AUTHENTICATE` clause will fail with a generic error. You can also choose to `THROW` a custom error as shown in the next example.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS user ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
    AUTHENTICATE {
        RETURN IF $auth.id {
            RETURN $auth.id;
        } ELSE IF $token.email {
            RETURN SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $token.email;
        };
    }
    WITH JWT ALGORITHM HS512 KEY 'secret'
;
```

#### Example: Failing authentication

Because the `AUTHENTICATE` clause is always executed across signin, signup and token authentication, it is in a unique position to centralize logic after user credentials are deemed valid, but before the user is completely authenticated.

Below, we show an example of validating if a user is enabled. If this is not the case, we can `THROW` an error stating why the user cannot authenticate, stopping the authentication attempt with a custom message. You can also choose to not return anything, which results in a generic authentication error. If the user is enabled, we can `RETURN` the record identifier, which confirms that authentication is successful and specifies that the record user which will be authenticated in the session is the same that was already authenticated.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS user ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
    SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass), enabled = true )
    SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
    AUTHENTICATE {
        IF !$auth.enabled {
            THROW "This user is not enabled";
        };

        RETURN $auth;
    }
;
```

#### Example: Auditing and revoking tokens

In addition to what is shown in the previous example, the `AUTHENTICATE` clause can also be used to create records and access the claims found in the token itself using the `$token` reserved parameter. These features can be combined to log authentication attempts and stop authentication from completing if some conditions are met.

Below, we show a proof of concept example that leverages the fact that tokens issued by SurrealDB have the standard `jti` claim, which contains a randomly generated unique identifier for the token. This value can be used to uniquely identify each token that is issued by SurrealDB for the purposes of auditing and revocation.

In this example, we create a new record in the `token` table for each token that SurrealDB issues after a successful `SIGNIN` and `SIGNUP`. This record is identified by the value in the `jti`(JWT ID) claim. Every time that a token is used to authenticate, we check if the record in the `token` table with identifier matching the `jti`(JWT ID) claim has been revoked and, if so, we fail authentication with a custom message. Otherwise, we log the time that the token was used to successfully authenticate in the `audit` table and continue authentication without changes.

```surql
DEFINE ACCESS user ON DATABASE TYPE RECORD
    SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass) )
    SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
    AUTHENTICATE {
        IF type::thing("token", $token.jti).revoked = true {
            THROW "This token has been revoked";
        };
        INSERT INTO token { id: $token.jti, exp: $token.exp, revoked: false };
        CREATE audit CONTENT { token: $token.jti, time: time::now() };
        RETURN $auth;
    }
    DURATION FOR TOKEN 30d, FOR SESSION 1h
;
```
