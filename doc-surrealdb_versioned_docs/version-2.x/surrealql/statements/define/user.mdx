# `DEFINE USER` statement

Use the `DEFINE USER` statement to create system users on SurrealDB

:::note 
___NOTE:___ While existing logins still function, the DEFINE LOGIN statement has been replaced with DEFINE USER.
:::

## Requirements

- You must be authenticated with a user that has enough permissions. Only the OWNER built-in role grants permissions to create users.
- You must be authenticated with a user that has permissions on the level where you are creating the user:
    - Root users can create Root, Namespace and Database users.
    - Namespace users can create Namespace and Database users
    - Database user can create Database users.
- To select the level where you want to create the user, [you may need to select a namespace and/or database](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/surrealql/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE USER` statement for database or namespace tokens.

:::note 
___NOTE:___ You cannot use the DEFINE USER statement to create a record user.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE USER [ IF NOT EXISTS ] @name
	ON [ ROOT | NAMESPACE | DATABASE ]
	[ PASSWORD @pass | PASSHASH @hash ]
	[ ROLES @roles ]
	[ DURATION [ FOR TOKEN @duration [ , ] ] [ FOR SESSION @duration ] ]
```

## Example usage 
The following example shows how you can create a `ROOT` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```surql
-- Create the user with an owner role and some example durations
DEFINE USER username ON ROOT PASSWORD '123456' ROLES OWNER DURATION FOR SESSION 15m, FOR TOKEN 5s;
```
The following example shows how you can create a `NAMESPACE` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```surql
-- Specify the namespace
USE NS abcum;
-- Create the user with an editor role and some example durations
DEFINE USER username ON NAMESPACE PASSWORD '123456' ROLES EDITOR DURATION FOR SESSION 12h, FOR TOKEN 1m;
```

The following example shows how you can create a `DATABASE` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.
```surql
-- Specify the namespace and database for the user
USE NS abcum DB app_vitalsense;
-- Create the user with a viewer role and some example durations
DEFINE USER username ON DATABASE PASSWORD '123456' ROLES VIEWER DURATION FOR SESSION 5d, FOR TOKEN 2h;
```

## Using `IF NOT EXISTS` clause <l className='purple'>Since 1.3.0</l>

The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define a user only if it does not already exist. If the user already exists, the `DEFINE USER` statement will return an error.

```surql
-- Create a USER if it does not already exist
DEFINE USER IF NOT EXISTS example ON ROOT PASSWORD "example" ROLES OWNER;
```

## Roles
Currently, only the built-in roles OWNER, EDITOR and VIEWER are available.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Role</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>OWNER</td>
    <td>Can view and edit any resource on the user's level or below, including user and token (IAM) resources.<br/>It also grants full permissions for child resources that support the `PERMISSIONS` clause (tables, fields, etc.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>EDITOR</td>
    <td>Can view and edit any resource on the user's level or below, but not users or token (IAM) resources<br/>It also grants full permissions for child resources that support the `PERMISSIONS` clause (tables, fields, etc.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VIEWER</td>
    <td>Grants permissions to view any resource on the user's level or below, but not edit.<br/>It also grants view permissions for child resources that support the `PERMISSIONS` clause (tables, fields, etc.)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Duration
The duration clause specifies the duration of the token returned after successful authentication with a password or passhash as well as the duration of the session established both using a password or passhash and the aforementioned token. The difference between these concepts is explained in the [expiration](/docs/surrealdb/2.x/security/authentication#expiration) documentation.
