# Embedded scripting functions

SurrealDB allows for advanced functions with complicated logic, by allowing embedded functions to be written in JavaScript. These functions support the ES2020 JavaScript specification.

## Simple function

Embedded JavaScript functions within SurrealDB support all functionality in the ES2020 specification including async / await functions, and generator functions. Any value from SurrealDB is converted into a JavaScript type automatically, and the return value from the JavaScript function is converted to a SurrealDB value.

```surql
CREATE person SET scores = function() {
	return [1,2,3].map(v => v * 10);
};
```
