# Parameters

Parameters can be used like variables to store a value which can then be used in subsequent queries. To define a parameter in SurrealQL, use the [`LET`](../surrealql/statements/let) statement. The name of the parameter should begin with a `$` character.

## Defining parameters within SurrealQL

```surql
-- Define the parameter
LET $suffix = "Morgan Hitchcock";
-- Use the parameter
CREATE person SET name = "Tobie " + $suffix;
-- (Another way to do the same)
CREATE person SET name = string::join(" ", "Jaime", $suffix);
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "id": "person:3vs17lb9eso9m7gd8mml",
        "name": "Tobie Morgan Hitchcock"
    }
]

[
    {
        "id": "person:xh4zbns5mgmywe6bo1pi",
        "name": "Jaime Morgan Hitchcock"
    }
]
```

A parameter can store any value, including the result of a query.

```surql
-- Assuming the CREATE statements from the previous example
LET $founders = (SELECT * FROM person);
RETURN $founders.name;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    "Tobie Morgan Hitchcock",
    "Jaime Morgan Hitchcock"
]
```

Parameters can be defined using SurrealQL as shown above, or can be passed in using the client libraries as request variables.

## Defining parameters within client libraries
SurrealDB's client libraries allow parameters to be passed in as JSON values, which are then converted to SurrealDB data types when the query is run. The following example show a variable being used within a SurrealQL query from the JavaScript library.

```javascript
let people = await surreal.query("SELECT * FROM article WHERE status INSIDE $status", {
	status: ["live", "draft"],
});
```

## Reserved variable names

SurrealDB automatically predefines certain variables depending on the type of operation being performed. For example, `$this` and `$parent` are automatically predefined for subqueries so that the fields of one can be compared to another if necessary. Other predefined variables like `$session` give access to parts of the current database configuration. You should not declare new parameters of your own using the same names as the predefined variables below.

### $before, $after

Represent the values before and after a mutation on a field.

```surql
CREATE cat SET name = "Mr. Meow", nicknames = ["Mr. Cuddlebun"];
UPDATE cat SET nicknames += "Snuggles" WHERE name = "Mr. Meow" RETURN $before, $after;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "after": {
            "id": "cat:6p71csv2zqianixf0dkz",
            "name": "Mr. Meow",
            "nicknames": [
                "Mr. Cuddlebun",
                "Snuggles"
            ]
        },
        "before": {
            "id": "cat:6p71csv2zqianixf0dkz",
            "name": "Mr. Meow",
            "nicknames": [
                "Mr. Cuddlebun"
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

### $auth

Represents the currently authenticated scope user.

```surql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL
    PERMISSIONS
        FOR select, update, delete WHERE id = $auth.id;
```

### $event

Represents the type of table event triggered on an event.

```surql
DEFINE EVENT user_created ON TABLE user WHEN $event = "CREATE" THEN (
    CREATE log SET table = "user", event = $event, created_at = time::now()
);
```

### $input

Represents the initially inputted value in a field definition, as the value clause could have modified the $value variable.

```surql
CREATE city:london SET
    population = 8900000,
    year = 2019,
    historical_data = [];

INSERT INTO city [
    { id: "london", population: 9600000, year: 2023 }
]
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
-- Stick old data into historical_data
historical_data += {
    year: year,
    population: population
},
-- Then update current record with the new input using $input
population = $input.population,
year = $input.year;
```

```bash output="Response"
[
    {
        "historical_data": [
            {
                "population": 8900000,
                "year": 2019
            }
        ],
        "id": "city:london",
        "population": 9600000,
        "year": 2023
    }
]
```

### $parent, $this

`$this` represents the current record in a subquery, and `$parent` its parent.

```surql
CREATE user SET name = "User1", member_of = "group1";
CREATE user SET name = "User2", member_of = "group1";
CREATE user SET name = "User3", member_of = "group1";
SELECT name, 
    (SELECT VALUE name FROM user WHERE member_of = $parent.member_of)
    AS group_members
    FROM user
    WHERE name = "User1";
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "group_members": [
            "User1",
            "User3",
            "User2"
        ],
        "name": "User1"
    }
]
```

```surql
INSERT INTO person (name) VALUES ("John Doe"), ("John Doe"), ("Jane Doe");
SELECT 
    *,
    (SELECT VALUE id FROM person WHERE $this.name = $parent.name) AS 
    people_with_same_name
    FROM person;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "id": "person:hwffcckiv61ylwiw43yf",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "people_with_same_name": [
            "person:hwffcckiv61ylwiw43yf",
            "person:tmscoy7bjj20xki0fld5"
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": "person:tmscoy7bjj20xki0fld5",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "people_with_same_name": [
            "person:hwffcckiv61ylwiw43yf",
            "person:tmscoy7bjj20xki0fld5"
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": "person:y7mdf3912rf5gynvxc7q",
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "people_with_same_name": [
            "person:y7mdf3912rf5gynvxc7q"
        ]
    }
]
```

### $scope

Represents the name of the scope of a currently authenticated scope user.

```surql
IF $scope = "admin" THEN
    ( SELECT * FROM account )
ELSE IF $scope = "user" THEN
    ( SELECT * FROM $auth.account )
ELSE
    []
END
```

### $session

Represents values from the session functions as an object.

```surql
CREATE user SET 
    name = "Some User",
    on_database = (SELECT VALUE db FROM ONLY $session);
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "id": "user:wa3ajflozlqoyurc4i4v",
        "name": "Some User",
        "on_database": "database"
    }
]
```

### $token

Represents values held inside the JWT token used for the current session.

```surql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMAFULL
  PERMISSIONS FOR select, update, delete, create
  WHERE $scope = "users"
  AND email = $token.email;
```

### $value

Represents the value after a mutation on a field (identical to $after in the case of an event).

```surql
DEFINE EVENT email ON TABLE user WHEN $before.email != $after.email THEN (
    CREATE event SET 
        user = $value.id,
        time = time::now(),
        value = $after.email,
        action = 'email_changed'
);
```
