# `THROW` statement

The `THROW` statement can be used to throw an error in a place where something unexpected is happening. Execution of the query will be aborted and the error will be returned to the client. Any value can be used as an error.

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
THROW @error
```

## Example usage

The following query shows example usage of this statement.

```surql
-- Throw an error
THROW "some error message";
```
The following query shows the `THROW` statement being used to send back a custom error to the client.

```surql
-- In this example, we throw a custom error when a user provides invalid signin details
DEFINE SCOPE user SESSION 1w
	SIGNIN {
		LET $user = SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = $username AND crypto::argon2::compare(password, $password);
		IF !$user {
			THROW "You either provided invalid credentials, or a user with the username " + <string> $username + " might not exist.";
		};

		RETURN $user;
	};
```

`THROW` can contain any value: arrays, objects, and so on. It can even take the value of a separate `SELECT` statement:

```surql
CREATE event SET time = time::now();
CREATE event SET time = time::now();
THROW SELECT * FROM event;
```

```bash title="Response"
"An error occurred: [{ id: event:0hscgodgumozmmq1inz7, time: '2024-05-01T04:18:50.502Z' }, { id: event:54qknk3trimrx6ana34e, time: '2024-05-01T04:18:50.503Z' }]"
```

`THROW` can also be used to cancel a transaction, usually inside an `IF` statement checking a condition.

```surql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
LET $transfer_amount = 150;
CREATE account:one SET dollars =  100;
CREATE account:two SET dollars =  100;
UPDATE account:one SET dollars -= $transfer_amount;
UPDATE account:two SET dollars += $transfer_amount;
IF account:one.dollars < 0 {
    THROW "Insufficient funds, would have $" + <string>account:one.dollars + " after transfer"
};
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM account;
```

```bash title="Output when $transfer_amount set to 150"
'An error occurred: Insufficient funds, would have $-50 after transfer'
```

```bash title="Output when $transfer_amount set to 50"
[
	{
		dollars: 50,
		id: account:one
	},
	{
		dollars: 150,
		id: account:two
	}
]
```
