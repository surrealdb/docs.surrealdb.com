# `SHOW` statement

The `SHOW` statement is used to replay changes made to a [table](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table#example-usage) that has a [Change Feed](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table#using-changefeed-clause) defined on it.

### Requirements
- You must first [`DEFINE`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table#example-usage) a [Change Feed](https://surrealdb.com/products/change-data-capture).

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE @tableName SINCE "@timestamp" | "@versionstamp" [LIMIT @number]
```
:::note
<em>Note:</em> The timestamp declared after `SINCE` needs to be after the time the `CHANGEFEED` was defined. Also, when defining a `CHANGEFEED` on a table, it implicitly creates a `CHANGEFEED` on the database.

## Example usage
### Basic usage

The following example shows usage of the SHOW statement.
<SurrealistMini

/>


From the example above, defining a `CHANGEFEED` on multiple tables still feeds their changes into a single database-wide changefeed. As a result, the `SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE 1 LIMIT 10;` query above for the `reading` table does not show changes for `versionstamp` 4 and 5, which pertain to changes for the `cat` table.
