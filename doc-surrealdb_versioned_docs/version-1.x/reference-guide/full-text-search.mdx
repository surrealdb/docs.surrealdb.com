# Full-Text Search
In SurrealDB, Full-Text Search supports text matching, proximity searches, result ranking, and keyword highlighting⁠.
It is also [ACID-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID), which ensures data integrity and reliability.⁠

## Define tables and fields
To implement Full-Text Search it is important that your data is first defined using SurrealDB [tables](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table) and [fields](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/field). 

## Analyzers
Once the data is in your tables, you can use customized [analyzers](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/analyzer) to define rules for how your textual data should be searched.
An analyzer includes [tokenizers](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/analyzer#tokenizers) and [filters](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/analyzer#filters) which help break down text into manageable tokens and refine the search.

```surql
-- Combining tokenizers and filters into a custom analyzer
DEFINE ANALYZER custom_analyzer TOKENIZERS blank FILTERS lowercase, snowball(english);
```
## Define a Full-Text Index
To make a text field searchable, you need to set up a [full-text index](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/indexes#full-text-search-index) on it by using the 'search' keyword.

Depending on the use case, each field can be associated with a different analyzer.
You can also use the `HIGHLIGHTS` keyword when you define an index along with your analyzer to highlight the content of that field. 

```surql
-- Defining two full-text indexes on the 'title' and 'content' field of the 'book' table
DEFINE INDEX book_title ON book FIELDS title SEARCH ANALYZER custom_analyzer BM25;
DEFINE INDEX book_content ON book FIELDS content SEARCH ANALYZER custom_analyzer BM25 HIGHLIGHTS;
```
## The MATCHES Operator
To find documents that contain the given keywords based on the full-text indexes, the [matches](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/operators#matches) operator (@@) is used in queries. 

```surql
-- Using the MATCHES (@@) operator in a query
SELECT * FROM book WHERE content @@ 'tools';
```
## Search Functions
If you want to do more with your search results, SurrealDB offers 3 search functions that accompany the matches operator.
- [`search::highlight`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/functions/database/search#searchhighlight): Highlights the matching keywords for the predicate reference number.
- [`search::offsets`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/functions/database/search#searchoffsets): Returns the position of the matching keywords for the predicate reference number.
- [`search::score`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/functions/database/search#searchscore): Helps with scoring and ranking the search results based on their relevance to the search terms.
