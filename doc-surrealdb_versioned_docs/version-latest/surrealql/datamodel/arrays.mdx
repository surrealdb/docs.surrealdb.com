# Arrays

Similar to Object-based Record IDs, records in SurrealDB can store arrays of values, with no limit to the depth of the arrays. Arrays can store any value stored within them, and can store different value types within the same array.

```surql
CREATE person SET results = [
	{ score: 76, date: "2017-06-18T08:00:00Z", name: "Algorithmics" },
	{ score: 83, date: "2018-03-21T08:00:00Z", name: "Concurrent Programming" },
	{ score: 69, date: "2018-09-17T08:00:00Z", name: "Advanced Computer Science 101" },
	{ score: 73, date: "2019-04-20T08:00:00Z", name: "Distributed Databases" },
];
```

A maximum number of items can be specified for an array.

```surql
DEFINE FIELD employees ON TABLE team TYPE array<record<employee>, 5>;
CREATE team SET employees = [
	employee:one, 
	employee:two, 
	employee:three, 
	employee:four, 
	employee:five, 
	employee:doesnt_belong
];
```

```bash title="Response"
'Expected a array<record<employee>, 5> but the array had 6 items'
```

## Working with arrays

An array can be followed 

```surql
[1,2,3][2];
```
