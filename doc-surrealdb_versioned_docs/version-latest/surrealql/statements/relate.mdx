# `RELATE` statement

The `RELATE` statement can be used to generate graph edges between two records in the database.

This allows you to traverse related records efficiently without needing to pull data from multiple tables and merging that data together using SQL JOINs.

Edges created using the RELATE statement are nearly identical to tables created using other statements.
The key differences are that

- Edge tables are deleted once there are no existing relationships left.
- Edge tables have two required fields `in` and `out`, which specify the directions of the relationships. These cannot be modified in schema declarations except to specify that they must be of a certain record type.

Thus, the following field declarations will work:

```surql
DEFINE FIELD in ON TABLE wrote TYPE record<author>;
DEFINE FIELD out ON TABLE wrote TYPE record<book>;
```

But this will be ignored:

```surql
DEFINE FIELD in ON TABLE wrote TYPE string;
DEFINE FIELD out ON TABLE wrote TYPE int;
```

Otherwise, edge tables behave like normal tables in terms of [updating](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/update), [defining a schema](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table) or [indexes](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/indexes).

[Record links](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/datamodel/records) are the alternative option when connecting data, and simply consist of a field with record IDs that serve as uni-directional links. The key differences are that graph relations

- Are kept in a separate table as opposed to a field inside a record.
- Offer bi-directional querying.
- Offer referential integrity.
- Allow you to store data alongside the relationship.

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
RELATE [ ONLY ] @from_record -> @table -> @to_record
	[ CONTENT @value
	  | SET @field = @value ...
	]
	[ RETURN NONE | RETURN BEFORE | RETURN AFTER | RETURN DIFF | RETURN @statement_param, ... ]
	[ TIMEOUT @duration ]
	[ PARALLEL ]
;
```

:::note
_Note_: `RELATE` will create a relation regardless of whether the records to relate to exist or not. As such, it is advisable to create the records you want to relate to before using `RELATE`, or to at least ensure that they exist before making a query on the relation. You can do this using the [CREATE statement](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/create). If the records to relate to don't exist, a query on the relation will still work without an error but will return an empty array.
:::

## Example usage
### Basic usage

The following query shows the basic structure of the `RELATE` statement, which creates a relationship between a record in the person table and a record in the article table.

For table names we prioritise readability, such that normal tables are singular, person instead of persons, but edge tables can be plural.

```surql
RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
	{
		"id": "wrote:ctwsll49k37a7rmqz9rr",
		"in": "person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg",
		"out": "article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm"
	}
]
```

There is no relationship information stored in either the person or article table.

Instead, an edge table (in this case a table called `wrote`) stores the relationship information. The structure `in -> id -> out` mirrors the record IDs from the `RELATE` statement, with the addition of the automatically generated ID for the wrote edge table.

By default, the edge table gets created as a schemaless table when you execute the `RELATE` statement. You can however make the table schemafull by either [defining a schema](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/table) before or after executing the RELATE statement.

A common use case is to make sure only unique relationships get created. You can do that by [defining an index](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/define/indexes).

```surql
DEFINE INDEX unique_relationships 
    ON TABLE wrote 
    COLUMNS in, out UNIQUE;
```
Edge tables are bi-directional by default. To enforce unidirectional relationships, you can restrict the type definition using field definition.

```surql
DEFINE FIELD in ON TABLE wrote TYPE record<person>;
DEFINE FIELD out ON TABLE wrote TYPE record<article>;
```

### Always two there are - no more, no less

A `RELATE` statement that involves an array instead of a single id will not fail. Instead, it will create a graph edge for each record in the array:

```surql
INSERT INTO cat (id) VALUES ("mr_meow", "mrs_meow", "kitten");
RELATE [cat:mr_meow, cat:mrs_meow]->parent_of->cat:kitten;
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "id": "parent_of:7ypx27tgoa9lrsa4s6fm",
        "in": "cat:mr_meow",
        "out": "cat:kitten"
    },
    {
        "id": "parent_of:mw08ri5e1jgh78wp1c1p",
        "in": "cat:mrs_meow",
        "out": "cat:kitten"
    }
]
```

Similarly, a `RELATE` statement that involves two arrays will return a number of graph edges equal to their product (in this case 2 * 2):

```surql
CREATE cat:kitten2;
RELATE [cat:mr_meow, cat:mrs_meow]->parent_of->[cat:kitten, cat:kitten2];
```

```bash title="Response"
[
    {
        "id": "parent_of:kvgu19yulq347b8xksxw",
        "in": "cat:mr_meow",
        "out": "cat:kitten"
    },
    {
        "id": "parent_of:xxvj5pkxci3k9bqm6br9",
        "in": "cat:mr_meow",
        "out": "cat:kitten2"
    },
    {
        "id": "parent_of:e4xwvecwwm6sxq1xe0yr",
        "in": "cat:mrs_meow",
        "out": "cat:kitten"
    },
    {
        "id": "parent_of:ub9t2mm948jfuup6r6c4",
        "in": "cat:mrs_meow",
        "out": "cat:kitten2"
    }
]
```

## Adding data using `SET` and `CONTENT`

Graph edges are standalone tables that can hold other fields besides the default `in`, `out`, and `id`. These can be added during a `RELATE` statement or during an `UPDATE` in the same manner as any other SurrealDB table.

Let's look at the two ways you can add record data in the `RELATE` statement. Both of these queries will produce the same result.

```surql
RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
    SET time.written = time::now();


RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
	CONTENT {
		time: {
			written: time::now()
		}
	};
```

Here is an example of a graph edge being updated in the same way as any other SurrealDB record:

```surql
-- Add a small synopsis composed of the table name and article ID
UPDATE wrote SET
    description = meta::tb(out) + ' written by ' + <string>in;
```

```bash title="Response"
    {
        "id": "wrote:s51jjewpw953ahysbhak",
        "in": "person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg",
        "out": "article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm",
        "description": "article written by person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg"
    }
```

### Passing variables in `CONTENT` and `SET` 

<Since v="v1.5.0" />

You can also pass variables in the `CONTENT` block. This is useful when you want to pass a variable that is not a record ID.

```surql
LET $time = time::now();
RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
    CONTENT {
        time: {
            written: $time
        }
    };
```

```bash title="Response"
    {
        "id": "wrote:ctwsll49k37a7rmqz9rr",
        "in": "person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg",
        "out": "article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm",
        "time": {
            "written": "2021-09-29T14:00:00Z"
        }
    }
```

Below is an example of how you can pass a variable in the `SET` block:

```surql
LET $time = time::now();

RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
    SET time.written = $time;
```

```bash title="Response"
    {
        "id": "wrote:ctwsll49k37a7rmqz9rr",
        "in": "person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg",
        "out": "article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm",
        "time": {
            "written": "2021-09-29T14:00:00Z"
        }
    }

```

## Creating a single relation with the `ONLY` keyword
Using the ONLY keyword, just an object for the relation in question will be returned. This, instead of an array with a single object.

```surql
RELATE ONLY person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm;
```

## Basics of querying graphs
Let's look at how the above gets queried, for more examples see the [SELECT docs](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/select).

For the questions below, each of the queries will give you the same answer. Note that whether `->` and `<-` are parsed as `in` or `out` depends on their direction in relation to the graph edge `wrote`. An arrow pointing towards `wrote` corresponds to `in`, and vice versa.

```surql
-- Who wrote the articles?
SELECT in FROM wrote;

SELECT ->wrote.in FROM person;
SELECT ->wrote<-person FROM person;

SELECT <-wrote.in FROM article;
SELECT <-wrote<-person FROM article;

-- Which articles did the person write?
SELECT out FROM wrote;

SELECT ->wrote.out FROM person;
SELECT ->wrote->article FROM person;

SELECT <-wrote.out FROM article;
SELECT <-wrote->article FROM article;

-- When was the article written?
SELECT time.written as time_written FROM wrote;
SELECT ->wrote.time.written as time_written FROM person;
SELECT <-wrote.time.written as time_written FROM article;
```

For a more complicated query like the one below you can use a simple rule of thumb:
Place the subject in front of the graph selection, then read it backward.

```surql
-- This query
SELECT ->purchased->product<-purchased<-person->purchased->product FROM person:tobie

-- Then becomes
person:tobie->purchased->product<-purchased<-person->purchased->product SELECT
```

Reading this backwards then makes more sense: <br/>

Select every product that was purchased by a person who purchased a product that was also purchased by person Tobie.

Alternatively, you can break it down in steps

```surql
-- Starting with Tobie
person:tobie

-- and his purchased products
->purchased->product

-- that were also purchased by persons
<-purchased<-person

-- what are all of those persons' purchased products?
->purchased->product
```

Putting it all together it would be:
based on all the products Tobie purchased, which person also purchased those products and what did they purchase?

## Structure of queries on relations

Using an alias is a common practice in both regular and relation queries in SurrealDB to make output more readable and collapse nested structures.

```surql
CREATE cat:one, cat:two, cat:three;

RELATE cat:one->friends_with->cat:two;
RELATE cat:two->friends_with->cat:three;

SELECT ->friends_with->cat->friends_with->cat FROM cat:one;
SELECT ->friends_with->cat->friends_with->cat AS friends_of_friends FROM cat:one;
```

```bash
// Output without alias
{
	"->friends_with": {
		"->cat": {
			"->friends_with": {
				"->cat": [
					cat:three
				]
			}
		}
	}
}

// Output with alias
{
	friends_of_friends: [
		cat:three
	]
}
```

However, an alias might not be preferred in a case where you have multiple graph queries that resolve to the fields of a large nested structure. Take the following data for example:

```surql
CREATE country:usa SET name = "USA";
CREATE state:pennsylvania SET population = 12970000;
CREATE state:michigan SET population = 10030000;
CREATE city:philadelphia, city:pittsburgh, city:detroit, city:grand_rapids;

RELATE country:usa->contains->[state:pennsylvania, state:michigan];
RELATE state:pennsylvania->contains->[city:philadelphia, city:pittsburgh];
RELATE state:michigan->contains->[city:detroit, city:grand_rapids];
```

A query on the states and cities of these records using aliases would return the data in a structure remade to fit the aliases declared in the query.

```surql
SELECT 
    name, 
    ->contains->state AS states,
    ->contains->state->contains->city AS cities
FROM country:usa;
```

```bash title="Output"
[
	{
		cities: [
			city:philadelphia,
			city:pittsburgh,
			city:grand_rapids,
			city:detroit
		],
		name: 'USA',
		states: [
			state:pennsylvania,
			state:michigan
		]
	}
]
```

However, opting to not use an alias will return the original graph structure which makes the levels of depth of the query clearer. In addition, the `population` field is clearly the population for the states.

```surql
SELECT 
    id,
    ->contains->state.id,
    ->contains->state.population,
    ->contains->state->contains->city.id
FROM country:usa;
```

```bash title="Output"
[
	{
		"->contains": {
			"->state": {
				"->contains": {
					"->city": {
						id: [
							city:philadelphia,
							city:pittsburgh,
							city:grand_rapids,
							city:detroit
						]
					}
				},
				id: [
					state:pennsylvania,
					state:michigan
				],
				population: [
					12970000,
					10030000
				]
			}
		},
		id: country:usa
	}
]
```

As the query that uses aliases does not maintain the original graph structure, adding `population` would require clever renaming such as `->contains->state.population AS state_populations` to make it clear that the numbers represent state and not city populations.

## Using [`LET`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/let) parameters in RELATE statements

You can also use [parameters](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/parameters) to specify the record IDs.

```surql
-- These two statements store the result of the subquery in a parameter
-- The subquery returns an array of IDs
LET $person = (SELECT VALUE id FROM person); 
LET $article = (SELECT VALUE id FROM article);

-- This statement creates a relationship record for every combination of Record IDs
-- Such that if we have 10 records each in the person and article table
-- We get 100 records in the wrote edge table (10*10 = 100)
-- In this case it would mean that each article would have 10 authors
RELATE $person->wrote->$article SET time.written = time::now();
```

## Using [`RETURN`](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/return) clause

By default, the relate statement returns the record value once the changes have been made. To change the return value of each record, specify a RETURN clause, specifying either `NONE`, `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, `DIFF`, or a comma-separated list of specific fields to return.

```surql
-- Don't return any result
RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
    SET time.written = time::now() 
    RETURN NONE;

-- Return the changeset diff
RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
    SET time.written = time::now() 
    RETURN DIFF;

-- Return the record before changes were applied
RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
    SET time.written = time::now() 
    RETURN BEFORE;

-- Return the record after changes were applied (the default)
RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
    SET time.written = time::now() 
    RETURN AFTER;

-- Return a specific field only from the updated records
RELATE person:l19zjikkw1p1h9o6ixrg->wrote->article:8nkk6uj4yprt49z7y3zm 
    SET time.written = time::now() 
    RETURN time;
```
## Using `TIMEOUT` clause

When processing a large result set with many interconnected records, it is possible to use the `TIMEOUT` keyword to specify a timeout duration for the statement. If the statement continues beyond this duration, then the transaction will fail, and the statement will return an error.

```surql
-- Cancel this conditional filtering based on graph edge properties
-- if it's not finished within 5 seconds
SELECT * FROM person WHERE ->knows->person->(knows WHERE influencer = true) TIMEOUT 5s;
```

## Using `PARALLEL` clause

When processing a large result set with many interconnected records, it is possible to use the `PARALLEL` keyword to signify that edges and remote records should be fetched and processed in parallel. This can be useful when you want to process a large result set in a short amount of time.

```surql
-- Fetch and process the person, purchased and product targets in parallel
-- Select every product that was purchased by a person that purchased a product that person tobie also purchased
SELECT ->purchased->product<-purchased<-person->purchased->product FROM person:tobie PARALLEL;
```

## Deleting graph edges
You can also delete graph edges between two records in the database by using the [DELETE statement](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/delete).

For example the graph edge below:

```surql
RELATE person:tobie->bought->product:iphone;
```

```bash title="Response"

[
	{
		"id": "bought:ctwsll49k37a7rmqz9rr",
		"in": "person:tobie",
		"out": "product:iphone"
	}
]
```

Can be deleted by:

```surql
DELETE person:tobie->bought WHERE out=product:iphone;
```
