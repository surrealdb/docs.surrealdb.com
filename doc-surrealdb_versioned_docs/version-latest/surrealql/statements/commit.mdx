# `COMMIT` statement

Each statement within SurrealDB is run within its own transaction by default. If a set of changes need to be made together, then groups of statements can be run together as a single transaction, either succeeding as a whole, or failing without leaving any residual data modifications. A `COMMIT` statement is used at the end of such a transaction to make the data modifications a permanent part of the database.

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
COMMIT [ TRANSACTION ];
```

## Example usage

The following query shows example usage of this statement.

```surql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Setup accounts
CREATE account:one SET balance = 135605.16;
CREATE account:two SET balance = 91031.31;

-- Move money
UPDATE account:one SET balance += 300.00;
UPDATE account:two SET balance -= 300.00;

-- Finalise all changes
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

The following two options can be used at any point if a transaction must be cancelled without commiting the changes:

* [CANCEL](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/cancel) to manually cancel the transaction,
* [THROW](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statetements/throw) to cancel a transaction with an optional error message. THROW is the only way to cancel a transaction based on a condition, such as inside an [IF..ELSE](/docs/surrealdb/surrealql/statements/ifelse) block.
