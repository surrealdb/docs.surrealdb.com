# DEFINE SCOPE

<br /><br />

# `DEFINE SCOPE` statement

<br /><br />

Setting scope access allows SurrealDB to operate as a web database. With scopes you can set authentication and access rules which enable fine-grained access to tables and fields.

## Requirements
- You must be authenticated as a root or namespace user before you can use the `DEFINE SCOPE` statement.
- [You must select your namespace and database](docs/surrealQl/statements/use) before you can use the `DEFINE SCOPE` statement.

## Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
DEFINE SCOPE @name SESSION @duration SIGNUP @expression SIGNIN @expression
```

## Example usuage 
Below shows how you can create a namespace using the `DEFINE PARAM` statement.

```surql
-- Enable scope authentication directly in SurrealDB
DEFINE SCOPE account SESSION 24h
	SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass) )
	SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
;
```
