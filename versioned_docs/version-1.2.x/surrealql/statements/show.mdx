# SHOW

# `SHOW` statement

The `SHOW` statement can be used to replay changes made to the table.

## Requirements
- You must first [`DEFINE`](https://docs.surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/statements/define/table#example-usage) a [Change Feed](https://surrealdb.com/cf).

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE @tableName [SINCE "@timestamp"] [LIMIT @number]
```

## Example usage
### Basic usage

The following expression shows usage of Show statement.

```surql
-- Define the change feed
DEFINE TABLE reading CHANGEFEED 1d;
DEFINE DATABASE foo CHANGEFEED 1h;

-- Create some records in the reading table
CREATE reading set story = "Once upon a time";
CREATE reading set story = "there was a database";

-- Replay changes to the reading table
SHOW CHANGES FOR TABLE reading SINCE "2023-09-07T01:23:52Z" LIMIT 10;
```

:::note
An important thing to note here is that the `SINCE <time>` needs to be after the time the `CHANGEFEED` was defined.
