# Run a disk based server

# Run a single-node, on-disk server

For the purposes of getting started with SurrealDB quickly, we will start a RocksDB database which persists data on the filesystem. This configuration is great for trying out the database and small deployments.

```bash 
surreal start file:mydatabase.db
```

The default logging level for the database server is `info`, resulting in any informational logs to be output to the standard output. To control the logging verbosity, specify the *`--log`* argument. The following command starts the database with `trace` level logging, resulting in most logs being output to the terminal.

```bash
surreal start --log trace file:mydatabase.db
```

In order to keep SurrealDB secure, configure your initial root-level user by setting the *`--user`* and *`--pass`* command-line arguments. The following command starts the database with a top-level user named root with a password also set to `root`. The root user will be persisted in storage, which means you don't have to include the command line arguments next time you start SurrealDB.

```bash
surreal start --log trace --user root --pass root file:mydatabase.db
```

In order to change the default port that SurrealDB uses for web connections and from database clients you can use the *`--bind`* argument. The following command starts the database on port `8080`.

```bash
surreal start --log trace --user root --pass root --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 file://path/to/mydatabase
```
After running the above command, you should see the SurrealDB server startup successfully.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass root --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 file:mydatabase.db
