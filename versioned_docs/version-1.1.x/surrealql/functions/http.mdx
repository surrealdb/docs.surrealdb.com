## `http::head`

The `http::head` function performs a remote HTTP `HEAD` request. The first parameter is the URL of the remote endpoint. If the response does not return a `2XX` status code, then the function will fail and return the error.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::head(string) -> null
```
If an object is given as the second argument, then this can be used to set the request headers.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::head(string, object) -> null
```

The following example shows this function, and its output, when used in a [`RETURN`](/docs/1.1.x/surrealql/statements/return) statement:

```surql
RETURN http::head('https://surrealdb.com');

null
```

To specify custom headers with the HTTP request, pass an object as the second argument:

```surql
RETURN http::head('https://surrealdb.com', {
	'x-my-header': 'some unique string'
});

null
```

<br />

## `http::get`

The `http::get` function performs a remote HTTP GET request. The first parameter is the URL of the remote endpoint. If the response does not return a 2XX status code, then the function will fail and return the error. If the remote endpoint returns an `application/json content-type`, then the response is parsed and returned as a value, otherwise the response is treated as text.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::get(string) -> value
```
If an object is given as the second argument, then this can be used to set the request headers.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::get(string, object) -> value
```

The following example shows this function, and its output, when used in a [`RETURN`](/docs/1.1.x/surrealql/statements/return) statement:

```surql
RETURN http::get('https://surrealdb.com');

-- The HTML code is returned
```

To specify custom headers with the HTTP request, pass an object as the second argument:

```surql
RETURN http::get('https://surrealdb.com', {
	'x-my-header': 'some unique string'
});

-- The HTML code is returned
```

<br />

## `http::put`

The `http::put` function performs a remote HTTP `PUT` request. The first parameter is the URL of the remote endpoint, and the second parameter is the value to use as the request body, which will be converted to JSON. If the response does not return a `2XX` status code, then the function will fail and return the error. If the remote endpoint returns an `application/json` content-type, then the response is parsed and returned as a value, otherwise the response is treated as text.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::put(string, object) -> value
```
If an object is given as the second argument, then this can be used to set the request headers.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::put(string, object, object) -> value
```

The following example shows this function, and its output, when used in a [`RETURN`](/docs/1.1.x/surrealql/statements/return) statement:

```surql
RETURN http::put('https://dummyjson.com/comments', {
  "id": 1,
  "body": "This is some awesome thinking!",
  "postId": 100,
  "user": {
    "id": 63,
    "username": "eburras1q"
  }
});


{
  "id": 1,
  "body": "This is some awesome thinking!",
  "postId": 100,
  "user": {
    "id": 63,
    "username": "eburras1q"
  }
}
```

<br />

## `http::post`

The `http::post` function performs a remote HTTP `POST` request. The first parameter is the URL of the remote endpoint, and the second parameter is the value to use as the request body, which will be converted to JSON. If the response does not return a `2XX` status code, then the function will fail and return the error. If the remote endpoint returns an `application/json` content-type, then the response is parsed and returned as a value, otherwise the response is treated as text.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::post(string, object) -> value
```
If an object is given as the second argument, then this can be used to set the request headers.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::post(string, object, object) -> value
```

The following example shows this function, and its output, when used in a [`RETURN`](/docs/1.1.x/surrealql/statements/return) statement:

```surql
RETURN http::post('https://dummyjson.com/comments/1', {
  "id": 1,
  "body": "This is some awesome thinking!",
  "postId": 100,
  "user": {
    "id": 63,
    "username": "eburras1q"
  }
});


{
  "id": 1,
  "body": "This is some awesome thinking!",
  "postId": 100,
  "user": {
    "id": 63,
    "username": "eburras1q"
  }
}
```

<br />

## `http::patch`

The `http::patch` function performs a remote HTTP `PATCH` request. The first parameter is the URL of the remote endpoint, and the second parameter is the value to use as the request body, which will be converted to JSON. If the response does not return a `2XX` status code, then the function will fail and return the error. If the remote endpoint returns an `application/json` content-type, then the response is parsed and returned as a value, otherwise the response is treated as text.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::patch(string, object) -> value
```
If an object is given as the second argument, then this can be used to set the request headers.

```surql title="API DEFINITION"
http::patch(string, object, object) -> value
```

The following example shows this function, and its output, when used in a [`RETURN`](/docs/1.1.x/surrealql/statements/return) statement:

```surql
RETURN http::patch('https://dummyjson.com/comments/1', {
  "id": 1,
  "body": "This is some awesome thinking!",
  "postId": 100,
  "user": {
    "id": 63,
    "username": "eburras1q"

{
  "id": 1,
  "body": "This is some awesome thinking!",
  "postId": 100,

The `http::delete` function performs a remote HTTP `DELETE` request. The first parameter is the URL of the remote endpoint, and the second parameter is the value to use as the request body, which will be converted to JSON.
