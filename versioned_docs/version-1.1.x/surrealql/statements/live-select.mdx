# LIVE SELECT

# `LIVE SELECT` statement

The `LIVE SELECT` statement can be used to initiate a real-time selection from a table, including the option to apply filters.

In practical terms, when you execute a `LIVE SELECT` query, it triggers an ongoing session that captures any subsequent changes to the data in real-time. These changes are then immediately transmitted to the client, ensuring that the client is consistently updated with the latest data modifications.

### Statement syntax

```surql title="SurrealQL Syntax"
LIVE SELECT
	[
		[ VALUE ] @fields [ AS @alias ]
		| DIFF
	]
	FROM @targets
	[ WHERE @conditions ]
	[ FETCH @fields ... ]
;
```

:::note
 <em> Note: </em> Support for FETCH is not yet available, but we are working on it.

## Example usage
### Basic usage

By default, SurrealDB will push the entire record over the websocket when created or updated, and just the record's ID when deleted.

```surql
LIVE SELECT * FROM person;

['b1f1d115-ad0f-460d-8cbf-dbc7ce48851c']
```

The result of the above query will be a UUID.
This UUID is the Live Query Unique ID, and is used to differentate between different Live Queries.
You will want to keep track of this ID, so that you can differentiate between different notifications being received after this query.
You can also use this UUID to [KILL (stop)](/docs/1.1.x/surrealql/statements/kill) the Live Query.

The protocol will then send messages that are of a Notification format.
You can find an example of such a message in the [Live Query WebSocket protocol](/docs/1.1.x/integration/websocket#live) description.

### Diff 

When using the `DIFF` mode, updates will be sent in the form of an array with [JSON Patch](https://jsonpatch.com/) messages.

```surql
LIVE SELECT DIFF FROM person;

['b87cbb0d-ca15-4f0a-8f86-caa680672aa5']
```
### Filter the live query

You can optionally apply filters with the `WHERE` clause.

```surql
LIVE SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 18;
```

## Consistency Guarantees

When using Live Queries, you want to understand the ordering of messages and events when many clients and transactions are running in paralllel.
We only publish notifications on live queries for committed transactions.

We make a best effort to assure ordering is correct, but don't have a strict correctness in place yet to guarantee that fully.  This means that some messages may be received out of order from their commit order.
However, transactions that are committed from the same client, are always going to be in order.

Security enforcement is always evaluated per notification and will reflect the value of authorisation at the time of publishing the notification.
This means that if a transaction is committed, then immediately the authorisation changes for the live query receiver, the receiver will get the notification under the new rules.
