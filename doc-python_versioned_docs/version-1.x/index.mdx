# Overview

The SurrealDB SDK for Python enables simple and advanced querying of a remote database from a browser or from server-side code. By default connections to SurrealDB are made over WebSockets, and automatically reconnect when the connection is terminated. We however also support connecting through a http client, however that is not as fully implemented yet.
