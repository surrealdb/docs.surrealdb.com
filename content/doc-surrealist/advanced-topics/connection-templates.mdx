# Connection Templates

When you find yourself frequently connecting to databases that share similar connection details, it might make sense to create a template.
Templates allow you to save partial connection details and reuse them when creating new connections.

## Creating a new template

Templates can be managed from the settings dialog under the "Templates" section. To create a new template, click the "New template" button and fill in the connection details you want to save.
All fields within a template are optional, so you can save as much or as little information as you like.
