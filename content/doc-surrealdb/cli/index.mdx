description: The SurrealDB command-line tool can be used to export a dataset as SurrealQL from a local or remote SurrealDB database, import SurrealQL data into a local or remote database, and start a single SurrealDB instance or distributed cluster.

# CLI tool

The SurrealDB command-line tool uses a single command for functionality such as [starting a single SurrealDB instance](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start), [exporting a dataset as a `.surql` file](/docs/surrealdb/cli/export), [importing SurrealQL](/docs/surrealdb/cli/import) into a local or remote database, [upgrading](/docs/surrealdb/cli/upgrade) to a new version of SurrealDB, or [opening a REPL](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) to make queries on a running instance.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Before using the CLI, you will need to [install SurrealDB](/docs/surrealdb/installation). To experiment with SurrealDB before installing, see the [Surrealist sandbox](https://app.surrealdb.com/).

## Getting Started

The CLI allows you to use the `surreal` command from your terminal or command prompt. This documentation provides detailed information on each command, including usage examples and options.

For a quickstart, [`surreal start`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/start) and [`surreal sql`](/docs/surrealdb/cli/sql) will be enough to get you started.

```bash
surreal start --user root --pass secret
```

Unless you specify otherwise, the CLI will start a database in memory that serves at `127.0.0.1:8000` (or `http://localhost:8000`). This database has a single root user named `root` and a password `secret`.

In another window, you can then open up an interactive shell to make queries using the  `surreal sql` command. As of SurrealDB 3.0, the `sql` command will connect to the default 'main' name for both namespace and database.

```bash
# Connect to namespace 'main' and database 'main'
surreal sql --username root --password secret --pretty

# Connect to a different namespace and database
surreal sql --namespace ns --database db --username root --password secret --pretty
```

> [!WARNING]
> Using generic usernames and passwords is not recommended for production use. Please replace the authentication credentials with your own.

This will start an interactive shell to make queries. The output below shows what you will see when logged in as the root user inside a namespace called `main` and a database called `main`, with pretty (easily readable) output per query.

You can then try out a few queries and see the output.

```bash
main/main> CREATE person SET age = 20;
main/main> CREATE person SET age = 30;
main/main> SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 25;
```

```surql title="Output"
[
	{
		age: 20,
		id: person:6jodx8xv39jsxdgykt0t
	}
]

[
	{
		age: 30,
		id: person:10bcq2owseyqqoinjgxl
	}
]

[
	{
		age: 30,
		id: person:10bcq2owseyqqoinjgxl
	}
]
```

We hope that the SurrealDB CLI simplifies your interactions with SurrealDB and empowers you to efficiently manage your databases and clusters. Let's dive into the CLI section and explore its capabilities!
